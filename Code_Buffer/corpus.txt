scene rome the conspirators camp near sardis  and the plains
of philippi


act i scene i
rome a street

enter flavius marullus and certain commoners

  flavius hence home you idle creatures get you home
    is this a holiday what know you not
    being mechanical you ought not walk
    upon a laboring day without the sign
    of your profession speak what trade art thou
  first commoner why sir a carpenter
  marullus where is thy leather apron and thy rule
    what dost thou with thy best apparel on
    you sir what trade are you
  second commoner truly sir in respect of a fine workman i am
    but as you would say a cobbler
  marullus but what trade art thou answer me directly
  second commoner a trade sir that i hope i may use with a
safe
    conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles
  marullus what trade thou knave thou naughty knave what
trade
  second commoner nay i beseech you sir be not out with me
yet
    if you be out sir i can mend you
  marullus what meanst thou by that mend me thou saucy
fellow
  second commoner why sir cobble you
  flavius thou art a cobbler art thou
  second commoner truly sir all that i live by is with the
awl i
    meddle with no tradesmans matters nor womens matters but
with
    awl i am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they are
in
    great danger i recover them as proper men as ever trod upon
    neats leather have gone upon my handiwork
  flavius but wherefore art not in thy shop today
    why dost thou lead these men about the streets
  second commoner truly sir to wear out their shoes to get
myself
    into more work but indeed sir we make holiday to see
caesar
    and to rejoice in his triumph
  marullus wherefore rejoice what conquest brings he home
    what tributaries follow him to rome
    to grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels
    you blocks you stones you worse than senseless things
    o you hard hearts you cruel men of rome
    knew you not pompey many a time and oft
    have you climbd up to walls and battlements
    to towers and windows yea to chimney tops
    your infants in your arms and there have sat
    the livelong day with patient expectation
    to see great pompey pass the streets of rome
    and when you saw his chariot but appear
    have you not made an universal shout
    that tiber trembled underneath her banks
    to hear the replication of your sounds
    made in her concave shores
    and do you now put on your best attire
    and do you now cull out a holiday
    and do you now strew flowers in his way
    that comes in triumph over pompeys blood
    be gone
    run to your houses fall upon your knees
    pray to the gods to intermit the plague
    that needs must light on this ingratitude
  flavius go go good countrymen and for this fault
    assemble all the poor men of your sort
    draw them to tiber banks and weep your tears
    into the channel till the lowest stream
    do kiss the most exalted shores of all
                                           exeunt all commoners
    see whether their basest metal be not moved
    they vanish tonguetied in their guiltiness
    go you down that way towards the capitol
    this way will i disrobe the images
    if you do find them deckd with ceremonies
  marullus may we do so
    you know it is the feast of lupercal
  flavius it is no matter let no images
    be hung with caesars trophies ill about
    and drive away the vulgar from the streets
    so do you too where you perceive them thick
    these growing feathers pluckd from caesars wing
    will make him fly an ordinary pitch
    who else would soar above the view of men
    and keep us all in servile fearfulness              exeunt




scene ii
a public place

flourish enter caesar antony for the course calpurnia
portia
decius cicero brutus cassius and casca a great crowd
follows
among them a soothsayer

  caesar calpurnia
  casca peace ho caesar speaks
                                                   music ceases
  caesar calpurnia
  calpurnia here my lord
  caesar stand you directly in antonios way
    when he doth run his course antonio
  antony caesar my lord
  caesar forget not in your speed antonio
    to touch calpurnia for our elders say
    the barren touched in this holy chase
    shake off their sterile curse
  antony i shall remember
    when caesar says do this it is performd
  caesar set on and leave no ceremony out           flourish
  soothsayer caesar
  caesar ha who calls
  casca bid every noise be still peace yet again
  caesar who is it in the press that calls on me
    i hear a tongue shriller than all the music
    cry caesar speak caesar is turnd to hear
  soothsayer beware the ides of march
  caesar what man is that
  brutus a soothsayer you beware the ides of march
  caesar set him before me let me see his face
  cassius fellow come from the throng look upon caesar
  caesar what sayst thou to me now speak once again
  soothsayer beware the ides of march
  caesar he is a dreamer let us leave him pass
                      sennet exeunt all but brutus and cassius
  cassius will you go see the order of the course
  brutus not i
  cassius i pray you do
  brutus i am not gamesome i do lack some part
    of that quick spirit that is in antony
    let me not hinder cassius your desires
    ill leave you
  cassius brutus i do observe you now of late
    i have not from your eyes that gentleness
    and show of love as i was wont to have
    you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
    over your friend that loves you
  brutus cassius
    be not deceived if i have veild my look
    i turn the trouble of my countenance
    merely upon myself vexed i am
    of late with passions of some difference
    conceptions only proper to myself
    which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors
    but let not therefore my good friends be grieved
    among which number cassius be you one
    nor construe any further my neglect
    than that poor brutus with himself at war
    forgets the shows of love to other men
  cassius then brutus i have much mistook your passion
    by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
    thoughts of great value worthy cogitations
    tell me good brutus can you see your face
  brutus no cassius for the eye sees not itself
    but by reflection by some other things
  cassius tis just
    and it is very much lamented brutus
    that you have no such mirrors as will turn
    your hidden worthiness into your eye
    that you might see your shadow i have heard
    where many of the best respect in rome
    except immortal caesar speaking of brutus
    and groaning underneath this ages yoke
    have wishd that noble brutus had his eyes
  brutus into what dangers would you lead me cassius
    that you would have me seek into myself
    for that which is not in me
  cassius therefore good brutus be prepared to hear
    and since you know you cannot see yourself
    so well as by reflection i your glass
    will modestly discover to yourself
    that of yourself which you yet know not of
    and be not jealous on me gentle brutus
    were i a common laugher or did use
    to stale with ordinary oaths my love
    to every new protester if you know
    that i do fawn on men and hug them hard
    and after scandal them or if you know
    that i profess myself in banqueting
    to all the rout then hold me dangerous
                                             flourish and shout
  brutus what means this shouting i do fear the people
    choose caesar for their king
  cassius ay do you fear it
    then must i think you would not have it so
  brutus i would not cassius yet i love him well
    but wherefore do you hold me here so long
    what is it that you would impart to me
    if it be aught toward the general good
    set honor in one eye and death i the other
    and i will look on both indifferently
    for let the gods so speed me as i love
    the name of honor more than i fear death
  cassius i know that virtue to be in you brutus
    as well as i do know your outward favor
    well honor is the subject of my story
    i cannot tell what you and other men
    think of this life but for my single self
    i had as lief not be as live to be
    in awe of such a thing as i myself
    i was born free as caesar so were you
    we both have fed as well and we can both
    endure the winters cold as well as he
    for once upon a raw and gusty day
    the troubled tiber chafing with her shores
    caesar said to me darest thou cassius now
    leap in with me into this angry flood
    and swim to yonder point upon the word
    accoutred as i was i plunged in
    and bade him follow so indeed he did
    the torrent roard and we did buffet it
    with lusty sinews throwing it aside
    and stemming it with hearts of controversy
    but ere we could arrive the point proposed
    caesar cried help me cassius or i sink
    i as aeneas our great ancestor
    did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder
    the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber
    did i the tired caesar and this man
    is now become a god and cassius is
    a wretched creature and must bend his body
    if caesar carelessly but nod on him
    he had a fever when he was in spain
    and when the fit was on him i did mark
    how he did shake tis true this god did shake
    his coward lips did from their color fly
    and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
    did lose his luster i did hear him groan
    ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans
    mark him and write his speeches in their books
    alas it cried give me some drink titinius
    as a sick girl ye gods it doth amaze me
    a man of such a feeble temper should
    so get the start of the majestic world
    and bear the palm alone shout                    flourish
  brutus another general shout
    i do believe that these applauses are
    for some new honors that are heapd on caesar
  cassius why man he doth bestride the narrow world
    like a colossus and we petty men
    walk under his huge legs and peep about
    to find ourselves dishonorable graves
    men at some time are masters of their fates
    the fault dear brutus is not in our stars
    but in ourselves that we are underlings
    brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar
    why should that name be sounded more than yours
    write them together yours is as fair a name
    sound them it doth become the mouth as well
    weigh them it is as heavy conjure with em
    brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar
    now in the names of all the gods at once
    upon what meat doth this our caesar feed
    that he is grown so great age thou art shamed
    rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods
    when went there by an age since the great flood
    but it was famed with more than with one man
    when could they say till now that talkd of rome
    that her wide walls encompassd but one man
    now is it rome indeed and room enough
    when there is in it but one only man
    o you and i have heard our fathers say
    there was a brutus once that would have brookd
    the eternal devil to keep his state in rome
    as easily as a king
  brutus that you do love me i am nothing jealous
    what you would work me to i have some aim
    how i have thought of this and of these times
    i shall recount hereafter for this present
    i would not so with love i might entreat you
    be any further moved what you have said
    i will consider what you have to say
    i will with patience hear and find a time
    both meet to hear and answer such high things
    till then my noble friend chew upon this
    brutus had rather be a villager
    than to repute himself a son of rome
    under these hard conditions as this time
    is like to lay upon us
  cassius i am glad that my weak words
    have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus

            reenter caesar and his train

  brutus the games are done and caesar is returning
  cassius as they pass by pluck casca by the sleeve
    and he will after his sour fashion tell you
    what hath proceeded worthy note today
  brutus i will do so but look you cassius
    the angry spot doth glow on caesars brow
    and all the rest look like a chidden train
    calpurnias cheek is pale and cicero
    looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
    as we have seen him in the capitol
    being crossd in conference by some senators
  cassius casca will tell us what the matter is
  caesar antonio
  antony caesar
  caesar let me have men about me that are fat
    sleekheaded men and such as sleep o nights
    yond cassius has a lean and hungry look
    he thinks too much such men are dangerous
  antony fear him not caesar hes not dangerous
    he is a noble roman and well given
  caesar would he were fatter but i fear him not
    yet if my name were liable to fear
    i do not know the man i should avoid
    so soon as that spare cassius he reads much
    he is a great observer and he looks
    quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays
    as thou dost antony he hears no music
    seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort
    as if he mockd himself and scornd his spirit
    that could be moved to smile at anything
    such men as he be never at hearts ease
    whiles they behold a greater than themselves
    and therefore are they very dangerous
    i rather tell thee what is to be feard
    than what i fear for always i am caesar
    come on my right hand for this ear is deaf
    and tell me truly what thou thinkst of him
              sennet exeunt caesar and all his train but casca
  casca you pulld me by the cloak would you speak with me
  brutus ay casca tell us what hath chanced today
    that caesar looks so sad
  casca why you were with him were you not
  brutus i should not then ask casca what had chanced
  casca why there was a crown offered him and being offered
him
     he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the
     people fell ashouting
  brutus what was the second noise for
  casca why for that too
  cassius they shouted thrice what was the last cry for
  casca why for that too
  brutus was the crown offered him thrice
  casca ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every time
gentler
    than other and at every putting by mine honest neighbors
    shouted
  cassius who offered him the crown
  casca why antony
  brutus tell us the manner of it gentle casca
  casca i can as well be hangd as tell the manner of it it was
    mere foolery i did not mark it i saw mark antony offer him
a
    crown yet twas not a crown neither twas one of these
    coronets and as i told you he put it by once but for all
    that to my thinking he would fain have had it then he
offered
    it to him again then he put it by again but to my
thinking he
    was very loath to lay his fingers off it and then he offered
it
    the third time he put it the third time by and still as he
    refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped
hands
    and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal
of
    stinking breath because caesar refused the crown that it had
    almost choked caesar for he swounded and fell down at it
and
    for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of opening my
lips
    and receiving the bad air
  cassius but soft i pray you what did caesars wound
  casca he fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and
was
    speechless
  brutus tis very like he hath the falling sickness
  cassius no caesar hath it not but you and i
    and honest casca we have the falling sickness
  casca i know not what you mean by that but i am sure caesar
fell
    down if the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him
    according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to
do
    the players in the theatre i am no true man
  brutus what said he when he came unto himself
  casca marry before he fell down when he perceived the common
    herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his
doublet
    and offered them his throat to cut an had been a man of any
    occupation if i would not have taken him at a word i would
i
    might go to hell among the rogues and so he fell when he
came
    to himself again he said if he had done or said anything
amiss
    he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity
three or
    four wenches where i stood cried alas good soul and
forgave
    him with all their hearts but theres no heed to be taken of
    them if caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have
done
    no less
  brutus and after that he came thus sad away
  casca ay
  cassius did cicero say anything
  casca ay he spoke greek
  cassius to what effect
  casca nay an i tell you that ill neer look you i the face
    again but those that understood him smiled at one another
and
    shook their heads but for mine own part it was greek to me
i
    could tell you more news too marullus and flavius for
pulling
    scarfs off caesars images are put to silence fare you
well
    there was more foolery yet if could remember it
  cassius will you sup with me tonight casca
  casca no i am promised forth
  cassius will you dine with me tomorrow
  casca ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
worth
    the eating
  cassius good i will expect you
  casca do so farewell both                            exit
  brutus what a blunt fellow is this grown to be
    he was quick mettle when he went to school
  cassius so is he now in execution
    of any bold or noble enterprise
    however he puts on this tardy form
    this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit
    which gives men stomach to digest his words
    with better appetite
  brutus and so it is for this time i will leave you
    tomorrow if you please to speak with me
    i will come home to you or if you will
    come home to me and i will wait for you
  cassius i will do so till then think of the world
                                                    exit brutus
    well brutus thou art noble yet i see
    thy honorable mettle may be wrought
    from that it is disposed therefore it is meet
    that noble minds keep ever with their likes
    for who so firm that cannot be seduced
    caesar doth bear me hard but he loves brutus
    if i were brutus now and he were cassius
    he should not humor me i will this night
    in several hands in at his windows throw
    as if they came from several citizens
    writings all tending to the great opinion
    that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely
    caesars ambition shall be glanced at
    and after this let caesar seat him sure
    for we will shake him or worse days endure           exit




scene iii
a street thunder and lightning

enter from opposite sides casca with his sword drawn and
cicero

  cicero good even casca brought you caesar home
    why are you breathless and why stare you so
  casca are not you moved when all the sway of earth
    shakes like a thing unfirm o cicero
    i have seen tempests when the scolding winds
    have rived the knotty oaks and i have seen
    the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
    to be exalted with the threatening clouds
    but never till tonight never till now
    did i go through a tempest dropping fire
    either there is a civil strife in heaven
    or else the world too saucy with the gods
    incenses them to send destruction
  cicero why saw you anything more wonderful
  casca a common slave you know him well by sight
    held up his left hand which did flame and burn
    like twenty torches joind and yet his hand
    not sensible of fire remaind unscorchd
    besides i ha not since put up my sword
    against the capitol i met a lion
    who glazd upon me and went surly by
    without annoying me and there were drawn
    upon a heap a hundred ghastly women
    transformed with their fear who swore they saw
    men all in fire walk up and down the streets
    and yesterday the bird of night did sit
    even at noonday upon the marketplace
    howling and shrieking when these prodigies
    do so conjointly meet let not men say
    these are their reasons they are natural
    for i believe they are portentous things
    unto the climate that they point upon
  cicero indeed it is a strangedisposed time
    but men may construe things after their fashion
    clean from the purpose of the things themselves
    comes caesar to the capitol tomorrow
  casca he doth for he did bid antonio
    send word to you he would be there tomorrow
  cicero good then casca this disturbed sky
    is not to walk in
  casca farewell cicero                          exit cicero

                        enter cassius

  cassius whos there
  casca a roman
  cassius casca by your voice
  casca your ear is good cassius what night is this
  cassius a very pleasing night to honest men
  casca who ever knew the heavens menace so
  cassius those that have known the earth so full of faults
    for my part i have walkd about the streets
    submitting me unto the perilous night
    and thus unbraced casca as you see
    have bared my bosom to the thunderstone
    and when the cross blue lightning seemd to open
    the breast of heaven i did present myself
    even in the aim and very flash of it
  casca but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
    it is the part of men to fear and tremble
    when the most mighty gods by tokens send
    such dreadful heralds to astonish us
  cassius you are dull casca and those sparks of life
    that should be in a roman you do want
    or else you use not you look pale and gaze
    and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
    to see the strange impatience of the heavens
    but if you would consider the true cause
    why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts
    why birds and beasts from quality and kind
    why old men fools and children calculate
    why all these things change from their ordinance
    their natures and preformed faculties
    to monstrous quality why you shall find
    that heaven hath infused them with these spirits
    to make them instruments of fear and warning
    unto some monstrous state
    now could i casca name to thee a man
    most like this dreadful night
    that thunders lightens opens graves and roars
    as doth the lion in the capitol
    a man no mightier than thyself or me
    in personal action yet prodigious grown
    and fearful as these strange eruptions are
  casca tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius
  cassius let it be who it is for romans now
    have thews and limbs like to their ancestors
    but woe the while our fathers minds are dead
    and we are governd with our mothers spirits
    our yoke and sufferance show us womanish
  casca indeed they say the senators tomorrow
    mean to establish caesar as a king
    and he shall wear his crown by sea and land
    in every place save here in italy
  cassius i know where i will wear this dagger then
    cassius from bondage will deliver cassius
    therein ye gods you make the weak most strong
    therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat
    nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass
    nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron
    can be retentive to the strength of spirit
    but life being weary of these worldly bars
    never lacks power to dismiss itself
    if i know this know all the world besides
    that part of tyranny that i do bear
    i can shake off at pleasure                  thunder still
  casca so can i
    so every bondman in his own hand bears
    the power to cancel his captivity
  cassius and why should caesar be a tyrant then
    poor man i know he would not be a wolf
    but that he sees the romans are but sheep
    he were no lion were not romans hinds
    those that with haste will make a mighty fire
    begin it with weak straws what trash is rome
    what rubbish and what offal when it serves
    for the base matter to illuminate
    so vile a thing as caesar but o grief
    where hast thou led me i perhaps speak this
    before a willing bondman then i know
    my answer must be made but i am armd
    and dangers are to me indifferent
  casca you speak to casca and to such a man
    that is no fleering telltale hold my hand
    be factious for redress of all these griefs
    and i will set this foot of mine as far
    as who goes farthest
  cassius theres a bargain made
    now know you casca i have moved already
    some certain of the noblestminded romans
    to undergo with me an enterprise
    of honorabledangerous consequence
    and i do know by this they stay for me
    in pompeys porch for now this fearful night
    there is no stir or walking in the streets
    and the complexion of the element
    in favors like the work we have in hand
    most bloody fiery and most terrible

                       enter cinna

  casca stand close awhile for here comes one in haste
  cassius tis cinna i do know him by his gait
    he is a friend cinna where haste you so
  cinna to find out you whos that metellus cimber
  cassius no it is casca one incorporate
    to our attempts am i not stayd for cinna
  cinna i am glad ont what a fearful night is this
    theres two or three of us have seen strange sights
  cassius am i not stayd for tell me
  cinna yes you are
    o cassius if you could
    but win the noble brutus to our party
  cassius be you content good cinna take this paper
    and look you lay it in the praetors chair
    where brutus may but find it and throw this
    in at his window set this up with wax
    upon old brutus statue all this done
    repair to pompeys porch where you shall find us
    is decius brutus and trebonius there
  cinna all but metellus cimber and hes gone
    to seek you at your house well i will hie
    and so bestow these papers as you bade me
  cassius that done repair to pompeys theatre
                                                     exit cinna
    come casca you and i will yet ere day
    see brutus at his house three parts of him
    is ours already and the man entire
    upon the next encounter yields him ours
  casca o he sits high in all the peoples hearts
    and that which would appear offense in us
    his countenance like richest alchemy
    will change to virtue and to worthiness
  cassius him and his worth and our great need of him
    you have right well conceited let us go
    for it is after midnight and ere day
    we will awake him and be sure of him                exeunt

act ii scene i

enter brutus in his orchard

  brutus what lucius ho
    i cannot by the progress of the stars
    give guess how near to day lucius i say
    i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly
    when lucius when awake i say what lucius

                            enter lucius

  lucius calld you my lord
  brutus get me a taper in my study lucius
    when it is lighted come and call me here
  lucius i will my lord                                 exit
  brutus it must be by his death and for my part
    i know no personal cause to spurn at him
    but for the general he would be crownd
    how that might change his nature theres the question
    it is the bright day that brings forth the adder
    and that craves wary walking crown him that
    and then i grant we put a sting in him
    that at his will he may do danger with
    the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
    remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar
    i have not known when his affections swayd
    more than his reason but tis a common proof
    that lowliness is young ambitions ladder
    whereto the climberupward turns his face
    but when he once attains the upmost round
    he then unto the ladder turns his back
    looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees
    by which he did ascend so caesar may
    then lest he may prevent and since the quarrel
    will bear no color for the thing he is
    fashion it thus that what he is augmented
    would run to these and these extremities
    and therefore think him as a serpents egg
    which hatchd would as his kind grow mischievous
    and kill him in the shell

                        reenter lucius

  lucius the taper burneth in your closet sir
    searching the window for a flint i found
    this paper thus seald up and i am sure
    it did not lie there when i went to bed
                                           gives him the letter
  brutus get you to bed again it is not day
    is not tomorrow boy the ides of march
  lucius i know not sir
  brutus look in the calendar and bring me word
  lucius i will sir                                     exit
  brutus the exhalations whizzing in the air
    give so much light that i may read by them
                                     opens the letter and reads
    brutus thou sleepst awake and see thyself
    shall rome etc speak strike redress

    brutus thou sleepst awake
    such instigations have been often droppd
    where i have took them up
    shall rome etc thus must i piece it out
    shall rome stand under one mans awe what rome
    my ancestors did from the streets of rome
    the tarquin drive when he was calld a king
    speak strike redress am i entreated
    to speak and strike o rome i make thee promise
    if the redress will follow thou receivest
    thy full petition at the hand of brutus

                        reenter lucius

  lucius sir march is wasted fifteen days
                                                knocking within
  brutus tis good go to the gate somebody knocks
                                                    exit lucius
    since cassius first did whet me against caesar
    i have not slept
    between the acting of a dreadful thing
    and the first motion all the interim is
    like a phantasma or a hideous dream
    the genius and the mortal instruments
    are then in council and the state of man
    like to a little kingdom suffers then
    the nature of an insurrection

                         reenter lucius

  lucius sir tis your brother cassius at the door
    who doth desire to see you
  brutus is he alone
  lucius no sir there are more with him
  brutus do you know them
  lucius no sir their hats are pluckd about their ears
    and half their faces buried in their cloaks
    that by no means i may discover them
    by any mark of favor
  brutus let em enter                            exit lucius
    they are the faction o conspiracy
    shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night
    when evils are most free o then by day
    where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
    to mask thy monstrous visage seek none conspiracy
    hide it in smiles and affability
    for if thou path thy native semblance on
    not erebus itself were dim enough
    to hide thee from prevention

    enter the conspirators cassius casca decius cinna
                metellus cimber and trebonius

  cassius i think we are too bold upon your rest
    good morrow brutus do we trouble you
  brutus i have been up this hour awake all night
    know i these men that come along with you
  cassius yes every man of them and no man here
    but honors you and every one doth wish
    you had but that opinion of yourself
    which every noble roman bears of you
    this is trebonius
  brutus he is welcome hither
  cassius this decius brutus
  brutus he is welcome too
cassius this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber
  brutus they are all welcome
    what watchful cares do interpose themselves
    betwixt your eyes and night
  cassius shall i entreat a word                 they whisper
  decius here lies the east doth not the day break here
  casca no
  cinna o pardon sir it doth and yongrey lines
    that fret the clouds are messengers of day
  casca you shall confess that you are both deceived
    here as i point my sword the sun arises
    which is a great way growing on the south
    weighing the youthful season of the year
    some two months hence up higher toward the north
    he first presents his fire and the high east
    stands as the capitol directly here
  brutus give me your hands all over one by one
  cassius and let us swear our resolution
  brutus no not an oath if not the face of men
    the sufferance of our souls the times abuse
    if these be motives weak break off betimes
    and every man hence to his idle bed
    so let highsighted tyranny range on
    till each man drop by lottery but if these
    as i am sure they do bear fire enough
    to kindle cowards and to steel with valor
    the melting spirits of women then countrymen
    what need we any spur but our own cause
    to prick us to redress what other bond
    than secret romans that have spoke the word
    and will not palter and what other oath
    than honesty to honesty engaged
    that this shall be or we will fall for it
    swear priests and cowards and men cautelous
    old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
    that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear
    such creatures as men doubt but do not stain
    the even virtue of our enterprise
    nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits
    to think that or our cause or our performance
    did need an oath when every drop of blood
    that every roman bears and nobly bears
    is guilty of a several bastardy
    if he do break the smallest particle
    of any promise that hath passd from him
  cassius but what of cicero shall we sound him
    i think he will stand very strong with us
  casca let us not leave him out
  cinna no by no means
  metellus o let us have him for his silver hairs
    will purchase us a good opinion
    and buy mens voices to commend our deeds
    it shall be said his judgement ruled our hands
    our youths and wildness shall no whit appear
    but all be buried in his gravity
  brutus o name him not let us not break with him
    for he will never follow anything
    that other men begin
  cassius then leave him out
  casca indeed he is not fit
  decius shall no man else be touchd but only caesar
  cassius decius well urged i think it is not meet
    mark antony so well beloved of caesar
    should outlive caesar we shall find of him
    a shrewd contriver and you know his means
    if he improve them may well stretch so far
    as to annoy us all which to prevent
    let antony and caesar fall together
  brutus our course will seem too bloody caius cassius
    to cut the head off and then hack the limbs
    like wrath in death and envy afterwards
    for antony is but a limb of caesar
    let us be sacrificers but not butchers caius
    we all stand up against the spirit of caesar
    and in the spirit of men there is no blood
    o that we then could come by caesars spirit
    and not dismember caesar but alas
    caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends
    lets kill him boldly but not wrathfully
    lets carve him as a dish fit for the gods
    not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds
    and let our hearts as subtle masters do
    stir up their servants to an act of rage
    and after seem to chide em this shall make
    our purpose necessary and not envious
    which so appearing to the common eyes
    we shall be calld purgers not murderers
    and for mark antony think not of him
    for he can do no more than caesars arm
    when caesars head is off
  cassius yet i fear him
    for in the ingrated love he bears to caesar
  brutus alas good cassius do not think of him
    if he love caesar all that he can do
    is to himself take thought and die for caesar
    and that were much he should for he is given
    to sports to wildness and much company
  trebonius there is no fear in himlet him not die
    for he will live and laugh at this hereafter
                                                  clock strikes
  brutus peace count the clock
  cassius the clock hath stricken three
  trebonius tis time to part
  cassius but it is doubtful yet
    whether caesar will come forth today or no
    for he is superstitious grown of late
    quite from the main opinion he held once
    of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies
    it may be these apparent prodigies
    the unaccustomd terror of this night
    and the persuasion of his augurers
    may hold him from the capitol today
  decius never fear that if he be so resolved
    i can oersway him for he loves to hear
    that unicorns may be betrayd with trees
    and bears with glasses elephants with holes
    lions with toils and men with flatterers
    but when i tell him he hates flatterers
    he says he does being then most flattered
    let me work
    for i can give his humor the true bent
    and i will bring him to the capitol
  cassius nay we will all of us be there to fetch him
  brutus by the eighth hour is that the utter most
  cinna be that the uttermost and fail not then
  metellus caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard
    who rated him for speaking well of pompey
    i wonder none of you have thought of him
  brutus now good metellus go along by him
    he loves me well and i have given him reasons
    send him but hither and ill fashion him
  cassius the morning comes upon s well leave you brutus
    and friends disperse yourselves but all remember
    what you have said and show yourselves true romans
  brutus good gentlemen look fresh and merrily
    let not our looks put on our purposes
    but bear it as our roman actors do
    with untired spirits and formal constancy
    and so good morrow to you every one
                                          exeunt all but brutus
    boy lucius fast asleep it is no matter
    enjoy the honeyheavy dew of slumber
    thou hast no figures nor no fantasies
    which busy care draws in the brains of men
    therefore thou sleepst so sound

                           enter portia

  portia brutus my lord
  brutus portia what mean you wherefore rise you now
    it is not for your health thus to commit
    your weak condition to the raw cold morning
  portia nor for yours neither have ungently brutus
    stole from my bed and yesternight at supper
    you suddenly arose and walkd about
    musing and sighing with your arms across
    and when i askd you what the matter was
    you stared upon me with ungentle looks
    i urged you further then you scratchd your head
    and too impatiently stampd with your foot
    yet i insisted yet you answerd not
    but with an angry waiter of your hand
    gave sign for me to leave you so i did
    fearing to strengthen that impatience
    which seemd too much enkindled and withal
    hoping it was but an effect of humor
    which sometime hath his hour with every man
    it will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep
    and could it work so much upon your shape
    as it hath much prevaild on your condition
    i should not know you brutus dear my lord
    make me acquainted with your cause of grief
  brutus i am not well in health and that is all
  portia brutus is wise and were he not in health
    he would embrace the means to come by it
  brutus why so i do good portia go to bed
  portia is brutus sick and is it physical
    to walk unbraced and suck up the humors
    of the dank morning what is brutus sick
    and will he steal out of his wholesome bed
    to dare the vile contagion of the night
    and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
    to add unto his sickness no my brutus
    you have some sick offense within your mind
    which by the right and virtue of my place
    i ought to know of and upon my knees
    i charm you by my once commended beauty
    by all your vows of love and that great vow
    which did incorporate and make us one
    that you unfold to me yourself your half
    why you are heavy and what men tonight
    have had resort to you for here have been
    some six or seven who did hide their faces
    even from darkness
  brutus kneel not gentle portia
  portia i should not need if you were gentle brutus
    within the bond of marriage tell me brutus
    is it excepted i should know no secrets
    that appertain to you am i yourself
    but as it were in sort or limitation
    to keep with you at meals comfort your bed
    and talk to you sometimes dwell i but in the suburbs
    of your good pleasure if it be no more
    portia is brutus harlot not his wife
  brutus you are my true and honorable wife
    as dear to me as are the ruddy drops
    that visit my sad heart
  portia if this were true then should i know this secret
    i grant i am a woman but withal
    a woman that lord brutus took to wife
    i grant i am a woman but withal
    a woman well reputed catos daughter
    think you i am no stronger than my sex
    being so fatherd and so husbanded
    tell me your counsels i will not disclose em
    i have made strong proof of my constancy
    giving myself a voluntary wound
    here in the thigh can i bear that with patience
    and not my husbands secrets
  brutus o ye gods
    render me worthy of this noble wife knocking within
    hark hark one knocks portia go in awhile
    and by and by thy bosom shall partake
    the secrets of my heart
    all my engagements i will construe to thee
    all the charactery of my sad brows
    leave me with haste exit portia lucius whos that
knocks

                  reenter lucius with ligarius

  lucius here is a sick man that would speak with you
  brutus caius ligarius that metellus spake of
    boy stand aside caius ligarius how
  ligarius vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue
  brutus o what a time have you chose out brave caius
    to wear a kerchief would you were not sick
  ligarius i am not sick if brutus have in hand
    any exploit worthy the name of honor
  brutus such an exploit have i in hand ligarius
    had you a healthful ear to hear of it
  ligarius by all the gods that romans bow before
    i here discard my sickness soul of rome
    brave son derived from honorable loins

    my mortified spirit now bid me run
    and i will strive with things impossible
    yea get the better of them whats to do
  brutus a piece of work that will make sick men whole
  ligarius but are not some whole that we must make sick
  brutus that must we also what it is my caius
    i shall unfold to thee as we are going
    to whom it must be done
  ligarius set on your foot
    and with a heart newfired i follow you
    to do i know not what but it sufficeth
    that brutus leads me on
  brutus follow me then                                exeunt




scene ii
caesars house thunder and lightning

enter caesar in his nightgown

  caesar nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight
    thrice hath calpurnia in her sleep cried out
    help ho they murther caesar whos within

                         enter a servant

  servant my lord
  caesar go bid the priests do present sacrifice
    and bring me their opinions of success
  servant i will my lord                                exit

                         enter calpurnia

  calpurnia what mean you caesar think you to walk forth
    you shall not stir out of your house today
  caesar caesar shall forth the things that threatend me
    neer lookd but on my back when they shall see
    the face of caesar they are vanished
  calpurnia caesar i i stood on ceremonies
    yet now they fright me there is one within
    besides the things that we have heard and seen
    recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
    a lioness hath whelped in the streets
    and graves have yawnd and yielded up their dead
    fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds
    in ranks and squadrons and right form of war
    which drizzled blood upon the capitol
    the noise of battle hurtled in the air
    horses did neigh and dying men did groan
    and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets
    o caesar these things are beyond all use
    and i do fear them
  caesar what can be avoided
    whose end is purposed by the mighty gods
    yet caesar shall go forth for these predictions
    are to the world in general as to caesar
  calpurnia when beggars die there are no comets seen
    the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes
  caesar cowards die many times before their deaths
    the valiant never taste of death but once
    of all the wonders that i yet have heard
    it seems to me most strange that men should fear
    seeing that death a necessary end
    will come when it will come

                      reenter servant

    what say the augurers
  servant they would not have you to stir forth today
    plucking the entrails of an offering forth
    they could not find a heart within the beast
  caesar the gods do this in shame of cowardice
    caesar should be a beast without a heart
    if he should stay at home today for fear
    no caesar shall not danger knows full well
    that caesar is more dangerous than he
    we are two lions litterd in one day
    and i the elder and more terrible
    and caesar shall go forth
  calpurnia alas my lord
    your wisdom is consumed in confidence
    do not go forth today call it my fear
    that keeps you in the house and not your own
    well send mark antony to the senate house
    and he shall say you are not well today
    let me upon my knee prevail in this
  caesar mark antony shall say i am not well
    and for thy humor i will stay at home

                        enter decius

    heres decius brutus he shall tell them so
  decius caesar all hail good morrow worthy caesar
    i come to fetch you to the senate house
  caesar and you are come in very happy time
    to bear my greeting to the senators
    and tell them that i will not come today
    cannot is false and that i dare not falser
    i will not come today tell them so decius
  calpurnia say he is sick
  caesar shall caesar send a lie
    have i in conquest stretchd mine arm so far
    to be afeard to tell greybeards the truth
    decius go tell them caesar will not come
  decius most mighty caesar let me know some cause
    lest i be laughd at when i tell them so
  caesar the cause is in my will i will not come
    that is enough to satisfy the senate
    but for your private satisfaction
    because i love you i will let you know
    calpurnia here my wife stays me at home
    she dreamt tonight she saw my statue
    which like a fountain with an hundred spouts
    did run pure blood and many lusty romans
    came smiling and did bathe their hands in it
    and these does she apply for warnings and portents
    and evils imminent and on her knee
    hath beggd that i will stay at home today
  decius this dream is all amiss interpreted
    it was a vision fair and fortunate
    your statue spouting blood in many pipes
    in which so many smiling romans bathed
    signifies that from you great rome shall suck
    reviving blood and that great men shall press
    for tinctures stains relics and cognizance
    this by calpurnias dream is signified
  caesar and this way have you well expounded it
  decius i have when you have heard what i can say
    and know it now the senate have concluded
    to give this day a crown to mighty caesar
    if you shall send them word you will not come
    their minds may change besides it were a mock
    apt to be renderd for someone to say
    break up the senate till another time
    when caesars wife shall meet with better dreams
    if caesar hide himself shall they not whisper
    lo caesar is afraid
    pardon me caesar for my dear dear love
    to your proceeding bids me tell you this
    and reason to my love is liable
  caesar how foolish do your fears seem now calpurnia
    i am ashamed i did yield to them
    give me my robe for i will go

         enter publius brutus ligarius metellus casca
                     trebonius and cinna

    and look where publius is come to fetch me

    as that same ague which hath made you lean

                           enter antony

    see antony that revels long o nights
    is notwithstanding up good morrow antony
  antony so to most noble caesar
  caesar bid them prepare within
    i am to blame to be thus waited for
    now cinna now metellus what trebonius
    i have an hours talk in store for you
    remember that you call on me today
    be near me that i may remember you
  trebonius caesar i will aside and so near will i be
    that your best friends shall wish i had been further
  caesar good friends go in and taste some wine with me
    and we like friends will straightway go together
  brutus aside that every like is not the same o caesar
    the heart of brutus yearns to think upon            exeunt

rome before the capitol the senate sitting above
a crowd of people among them artemidorus and the soothsayer

      caesar goes up to the senate house the rest follow

  popilius i wish your enterprise today may thrive
  cassius what enterprise popilius
  popilius fare you well
                                             advances to caesar
  brutus what said popilius lena
  cassius he wishd today our enterprise might thrive
    i fear our purpose is discovered
  brutus look how he makes to caesar mark him
  cassius casca
    be sudden for we fear prevention
    brutus what shall be done if this be known
    cassius or caesar never shall turn back
    for i will slay myself
  brutus cassius be constant
    popilius lena speaks not of our purposes
    for look he smiles and caesar doth not change
  cassius trebonius knows his time for look you brutus
    he draws mark antony out of the way
                                    exeunt antony and trebonius
  decius where is metellus cimber let him
    and presently prefer his suit to caesar
  brutus he is addressd press near and second him
  cinna casca you are the first that rears your hand
  caesar are we all ready what is now amiss
    that caesar and his senate must redress
  metellus most high most mighty and most puissant caesar
    metellus cimber throws before thy seat
    an humble heart                                     kneels
  caesar i must prevent thee cimber
    these couchings and these lowly courtesies
    might fire the blood of ordinary men
    and turn preordinance and first decree
    into the law of children be not fond
    to think that caesar bears such rebel blood
    that will be thawd from the true quality
    with that which melteth fools i mean sweet words
    lowcrooked courtsies and base spanielfawning
    thy brother by decree is banished
    if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him
    i spurn thee like a cur out of my way
    know caesar doth not wrong nor without cause
    will he be satisfied
  metellus is there no voice more worthy than my own
    to sound more sweetly in great caesars ear
    for the repealing of my banishd brother
  brutus i kiss thy hand but not in flattery caesar
    desiring thee that publius cimber may
    have an immediate freedom of repeal
  caesar what brutus
  cassius pardon caesar caesar pardon
    as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall
    to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber
  caesar i could be well moved if i were as you
    if i could pray to move prayers would move me
    but i am constant as the northern star
    of whose truefixd and resting quality
    there is no fellow in the firmament
    the skies are painted with unnumberd sparks
    they are all fire and every one doth shine
    but theres but one in all doth hold his place
    so in the world tis furnishd well with men
    and men are flesh and blood and apprehensive
    yet in the number i do know but one
    that unassailable holds on his rank
    unshaked of motion and that i am he
    let me a little show it even in this
    that i was constant cimber should be banishd
    and constant do remain to keep him so
  cinna o caesar
  caesar hence wilt thou lift up olympus
  decius great caesar
  caesar doth not brutus bootless kneel
  casca speak hands for me
                        casca first then the other conspirators
                                  and marcus brutus stab caesar

    fly not stand still ambitions debt is paid
  casca go to the pulpit brutus
  decius and cassius too
  brutus wheres publius
  cinna here quite confounded with this mutiny
  metellus stand fast together lest some friend of caesars
    should chance
  brutus talk not of standing publius good cheer
    there is no harm intended to your person
    nor to no roman else so tell them publius
  cassius and leave us publius lest that the people
    rushing on us should do your age some mischief
  brutus do so and let no man abide this deed
    but we the doers

                        reenter trebonius

  cassius where is antony
  trebonius fled to his house amazed
    men wives and children stare cry out and run
    as it were doomsday
  brutus fates we will know your pleasures
    that we shall die we know tis but the time
    and drawing days out that men stand upon
  cassius why he that cuts off twenty years of life
    cuts off so many years of fearing death
  brutus grant that and then is death a benefit
    so are we caesars friends that have abridged
    his time of fearing death stoop romans stoop
    and let us bathe our hands in caesars blood
    up to the elbows and besmear our swords
    then walk we forth even to the marketplace
    and waving our red weapons oer our heads
    lets all cry peace freedom and liberty
  cassius stoop then and wash how many ages hence
    shall this our lofty scene be acted over
    in states unborn and accents yet unknown
  brutus how many times shall caesar bleed in sport
    that now on pompeys basis lies along
    no worthier than the dust
  cassius so oft as that shall be
    so often shall the knot of us be calld
    the men that gave their country liberty
  decius what shall we forth
  cassius ay every man away
    brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels
    with the most boldest and best hearts of rome

                        enter a servant

  brutus soft who comes here a friend of antonys
  servant thus brutus did my master bid me kneel
    thus did mark antony bid me fall down
    and being prostrate thus he bade me say
    brutus is noble wise valiant and honest
    caesar was mighty bold royal and loving
    say i love brutus and i honor him
    say i feard caesar honord him and loved him
    if brutus will vouchsafe that antony
    may safely come to him and be resolved
    how caesar hath deserved to lie in death
    mark antony shall not love caesar dead
    so well as brutus living but will follow
    the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus
    thorough the hazards of this untrod state
    with all true faith so says my master antony
  brutus thy master is a wise and valiant roman
    i never thought him worse
    tell him so please him come unto this place
    he shall be satisfied and by my honor
    depart untouchd
  servant ill fetch him presently                       exit
  brutus i know that we shall have him well to friend
  cassius i wish we may but yet have i a mind
    that fears him much and my misgiving still
    falls shrewdly to the purpose

                          reenter antony

  brutus but here comes antony welcome mark antony
  antony o mighty caesar dost thou lie so low
    are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils
    shrunk to this little measure fare thee well
    i know not gentlemen what you intend
    who else must be let blood who else is rank
    if i myself there is no hour so fit
    as caesars deaths hour nor no instrument
    of half that worth as those your swords made rich
    with the most noble blood of all this world
    i do beseech ye if you bear me hard
    now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke
    fulfill your pleasure live a thousand years
    i shall not find myself so apt to die
    no place will please me so no means of death
    as here by caesar and by you cut off
    the choice and master spirits of this age
  brutus o antony beg not your death of us
    though now we must appear bloody and cruel
    as by our hands and this our present act
    you see we do yet see you but our hands
    and this the bleeding business they have done
    our hearts you see not they are pitiful
    and pity to the general wrong of rome
    as fire drives out fire so pity pity
    hath done this deed on caesar for your part
    to you our swords have leaden points mark antony
    our arms in strength of malice and our hearts
    of brothers temper do receive you in
    with all kind love good thoughts and reverence
  cassius your voice shall be as strong as any mans
    in the disposing of new dignities
  brutus only be patient till we have appeased
    the multitude beside themselves with fear
    and then we will deliver you the cause
    why i that did love caesar when i struck him
    have thus proceeded
  antony i doubt not of your wisdom
    let each man render me his bloody hand
    first marcus brutus will i shake with you
    next caius cassius do i take your hand
    now decius brutus yours now yours metellus
    yours cinna and my valiant casca yours
    though last not least in love yours good trebonius
    gentlemen all alas what shall i say
    my credit now stands on such slippery ground
    that one of two bad ways you must conceit me
    either a coward or a flatterer
    that i did love thee caesar o tis true
    if then thy spirit look upon us now
    shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
    to see thy antony making his peace
    shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes
    most noble in the presence of thy corse
    had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds
    weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood
    it would become me better than to close
    in terms of friendship with thine enemies
    pardon me julius here wast thou bayd brave hart
    here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand
    signd in thy spoil and crimsond in thy lethe
    o world thou wast the forest to this hart
    and this indeed o world the heart of thee
    how like a deer strucken by many princes
    dost thou here lie
  cassius mark antony
  antony pardon me caius cassius
    the enemies of caesar shall say this
    then in a friend it is cold modesty
  cassius i blame you not for praising caesar so
    but what compact mean you to have with us
    will you be prickd in number of our friends
    or shall we on and not depend on you
  antony therefore i took your hands but was indeed
    swayd from the point by looking down on caesar
    friends am i with you all and love you all
    upon this hope that you shall give me reasons
    why and wherein caesar was dangerous
  brutus or else were this a savage spectacle
    our reasons are so full of good regard
    that were you antony the son of caesar
    you should be satisfied
  antony thats all i seek
    and am moreover suitor that i may
    produce his body to the marketplace
    and in the pulpit as becomes a friend
    speak in the order of his funeral
  brutus you shall mark antony
  cassius brutus a word with you
    aside to brutus you know not what you do do not consent
    that antony speak in his funeral
    know you how much the people may be moved
    by that which he will utter
  brutus by your pardon
    i will myself into the pulpit first
    and show the reason of our caesars death
    what antony shall speak i will protest
    he speaks by leave and by permission
    and that we are contented caesar shall
    have all true rites and lawful ceremonies
    it shall advantage more than do us wrong
  cassius i know not what may fall i like it not
  brutus mark antony here take you caesars body
    you shall not in your funeral speech blame us
    but speak all good you can devise of caesar
    and say you dot by our permission
    else shall you not have any hand at all
    about his funeral and you shall speak
    in the same pulpit whereto i am going
    after my speech is ended
  antony be it so
    i do desire no more
  brutus prepare the body then and follow us
                                          exeunt all but antony
  antony o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
    that i am meek and gentle with these butchers
    thou art the ruins of the noblest man
    that ever lived in the tide of times
    woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
    over thy wounds now do i prophesy
    which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
    to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
    a curse shall light upon the limbs of men
    domestic fury and fierce civil strife
    shall cumber all the parts of italy
    blood and destruction shall be so in use
    and dreadful objects so familiar
    that mothers shall but smile when they behold
    their infants quarterd with the hands of war
    all pity choked with custom of fell deeds
    and caesars spirit ranging for revenge
    with ate by his side come hot from hell
    shall in these confines with a monarchs voice
    cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war
    that this foul deed shall smell above the earth
    with carrion men groaning for burial

                        enter a servant

scene ii
the forum

enter brutus and cassius and a throng of citizens

  citizens we will be satisfied let us be satisfied
  brutus then follow me and give me audience friends
    cassius go you into the other street
    and part the numbers
    those that will hear me speak let em stay here
    those that will follow cassius go with him
    and public reasons shall be rendered
    of caesars death
  first citizen i will hear brutus speak
  second citizen i will hear cassius and compare their reasons
    when severally we hear them rendered
                               exit cassius with some citizens
                                    brutus goes into the pulpit
  third citizen the noble brutus is ascended silence
  brutus be patient till the last
    romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my cause and be
    silent that you may hear believe me for mine honor and
have
    respect to mine honor that you may believe censure me in
your
    wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge
if
    there be any in this assembly any dear friend of caesars
to
    him i say that brutus love to caesar was no less than his
if
    then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar this
is
    my answer not that i loved caesar less but that i loved
rome
    more had you rather caesar were living and die all slaves
than
    that caesar were dead to live all freemen as caesar loved
me i
    weep for him as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was
    valiant i honor him but as he was ambitious i slew him
there
    is tears for his love joy for his fortune honor for his
valor
    and death for his ambition who is here so base that would be
a
    bondman if any speak for him have i offended who is here
so
    rude that would not be a roman if any speak for him have i
    offended who is here so vile that will not love his country
if
    any speak for him have i offended i pause for a reply
  all none brutus none
  brutus then none have i offended i have done no more to
caesar
    than you shall do to brutus the question of his death is
    enrolled in the capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he
was
    worthy nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered
death

              enter antony and others with caesars body

    here comes his body mourned by mark antony who though he
had
    no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying
a
    place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not with
this i
    depart that as i slew my best lover for the good of rome i
    have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my
country
    to need my death

  first citizen bring him with triumph home unto his house
  second citizen give him a statue with his ancestors
  third citizen let him be caesar
  fourth citizen caesars better parts
    shall be crownd in brutus
  first citizen well bring him to his house with shouts and
    clamors
  brutus my countrymen
  second citizen peace silence brutus speaks
  first citizen peace ho
  brutus good countrymen let me depart alone
    and for my sake stay here with antony
    do grace to caesars corse and grace his speech
    tending to caesars glories which mark antony
    by our permission is allowd to make
    i do entreat you not a man depart
    save i alone till antony have spoke                  exit
  first citizen stay ho and let us hear mark antony
  third citizen let him go up into the public chair
    well hear him noble antony go up
  antony for brutus sake i am beholding to you
                                           goes into the pulpit
  fourth citizen what does he say of brutus
  third citizen he says for brutus sake
    he finds himself beholding to us all
  fourth citizen twere best he speak no harm of brutus here
  first citizen this caesar was a tyrant
  third citizen nay thats certain
    we are blest that rome is rid of him
  second citizen peace let us hear what antony can say
  antony you gentle romans
  all peace ho let us hear him
  antony friends romans countrymen lend me your ears
    i come to bury caesar not to praise him
    the evil that men do lives after them
    the good is oft interred with their bones
    so let it be with caesar the noble brutus
    hath told you caesar was ambitious
    if it were so it was a grievous fault
    and grievously hath caesar answerd it
    here under leave of brutus and the rest
    for brutus is an honorable man
    so are they all all honorable men
    come i to speak in caesars funeral
    he was my friend faithful and just to me
    but brutus says he was ambitious
    and brutus is an honorable man
    he hath brought many captives home to rome
    whose ransoms did the general coffers fill
    did this in caesar seem ambitious
    when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept
    ambition should be made of sterner stuff
    yet brutus says he was ambitious
    and brutus is an honorable man
    you all did see that on the lupercal
    i thrice presented him a kingly crown
    which he did thrice refuse was this ambition
    yet brutus says he was ambitious
    and sure he is an honorable man
    i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke
    but here i am to speak what i do know
    you all did love him once not without cause
    what cause withholds you then to mourn for him
    o judgement thou art fled to brutish beasts
    and men have lost their reason bear with me
    my heart is in the coffin there with caesar
    and i must pause till it come back to me
  first citizen methinks there is much reason in his sayings
  second citizen if thou consider rightly of the matter
    caesar has had great wrong
  third citizen has he masters
    i fear there will a worse come in his place
  fourth citizen markd ye his words he would not take the
crown
    therefore tis certain he was not ambitious
  first citizen if it be found so some will dear abide it
  second citizen poor soul his eyes are red as fire with
weeping
  third citizen theres not a nobler man in rome than antony
  fourth citizen now mark him he begins again to speak
  antony but yesterday the word of caesar might
    have stood against the world now lies he there
    and none so poor to do him reverence
    o masters if i were disposed to stir
    your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage
    i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong
    who you all know are honorable men
    i will not do them wrong i rather choose
    to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you
    than i will wrong such honorable men
    but heres a parchment with the seal of caesar
    i found it in his closet tis his will
    let but the commons hear this testament
    which pardon me i do not mean to read
    and they would go and kiss dead caesars wounds
    and dip their napkins in his sacred blood
    yea beg a hair of him for memory
    and dying mention it within their wills
    bequeathing it as a rich legacy
    unto their issue
  fourth citizen well hear the will read it mark antony
  all the will the will we will hear caesars will
  antony have patience gentle friends i must not read it
    it is not meet you know how caesar loved you
    you are not wood you are not stones but men
    and being men hearing the will of caesar
    it will inflame you it will make you mad
    tis good you know not that you are his heirs
    for if you should o what would come of it
  fourth citizen read the will well hear it antony
    you shall read us the will caesars will
  antony will you be patient will you stay awhile
    i have oershot myself to tell you of it
    i fear i wrong the honorable men
    whose daggers have stabbd caesar i do fear it
  fourth citizen they were traitors honorable men
  all the will the testament
  second citizen they were villains murtherers the will
    read the will
  antony you will compel me then to read the will
    then make a ring about the corse of caesar
    and let me show you him that made the will
    shall i descend and will you give me leave
  all come down
  second citizen descend
                                  he comes down from the pulpit
  third citizen you shall have leave
  fourth citizen a ring stand round
  first citizen stand from the hearse stand from the body
  second citizen room for antony most noble antony
  antony nay press not so upon me stand far off
  all stand back room bear back
  antony if you have tears prepare to shed them now
    you all do know this mantle i remember
    the first time ever caesar put it on
    twas on a summers evening in his tent
    that day he overcame the nervii
    look in this place ran cassius dagger through
    see what a rent the envious casca made
    through this the wellbeloved brutus stabbd
    and as he pluckd his cursed steel away
    mark how the blood of caesar followd it
    as rushing out of doors to be resolved
    if brutus so unkindly knockd or no
    for brutus as you know was caesars angel
    judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him
    this was the most unkindest cut of all
    for when the noble caesar saw him stab
    ingratitude more strong than traitors arms
    quite vanquishd him then burst his mighty heart
    and in his mantle muffling up his face
    even at the base of pompeys statue
    which all the while ran blood great caesar fell
    o what a fall was there my countrymen
    then i and you and all of us fell down
    whilst bloody treason flourishd over us
    o now you weep and i perceive you feel
    the dint of pity these are gracious drops
    kind souls what weep you when you but behold
    our caesars vesture wounded look you here
    here is himself marrd as you see with traitors
  first citizen o piteous spectacle
  second citizen o noble caesar
  third citizen o woeful day
  fourth citizen o traitors villains
  first citizen o most bloody sight
  second citizen we will be revenged
  all revenge about seek burn fire kill
    slay let not a traitor live
  antony stay countrymen
  first citizen peace there hear the noble antony
  second citizen well hear him well follow him well die
with
    him
  antony good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up
    to such a sudden flood of mutiny
    they that have done this deed are honorable
    what private griefs they have alas i know not
    that made them do it they are wise and honorable
    and will no doubt with reasons answer you
    i come not friends to steal away your hearts
    i am no orator as brutus is
    but as you know me all a plain blunt man
    that love my friend and that they know full well
    that gave me public leave to speak of him
    for i have neither wit nor words nor worth
    action nor utterance nor the power of speech
    to stir mens blood i only speak right on
    i tell you that which you yourselves do know
    show you sweet caesars wounds poor dumb mouths
    and bid them speak for me but were i brutus
    and brutus antony there were an antony
    would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
    in every wound of caesar that should move
    the stones of rome to rise and mutiny

    his private arbors and newplanted orchards
    on this side tiber he hath left them you
    and to your heirs forever common pleasures
    to walk abroad and recreate yourselves
    here was a caesar when comes such another

act iv scene i
a house in rome antony octavius and lepidus seated at a
table

  antony these many then shall die their names are prickd
  octavius your brother too must die consent you lepidus
  lepidus i do consent
  octavius prick him down antony
  lepidus upon condition publius shall not live
    who is your sisters son mark antony
  antony he shall not live look with a spot i damn him
    but lepidus go you to caesars house
    fetch the will hither and we shall determine
    how to cut off some charge in legacies
  lepidus what shall i find you here
  octavius or here or at the capitol            exit lepidus
  antony this is a slight unmeritable man
    meet to be sent on errands is it fit
    the threefold world divided he should stand
    one of the three to share it
  octavius so you thought him
    and took his voice who should be prickd to die
    in our black sentence and proscription
  antony octavius i have seen more days than you
    and though we lay these honors on this man
    to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads
    he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold
    to groan and sweat under the business
    either led or driven as we point the way
    and having brought our treasure where we will
    then take we down his load and turn him off
    like to the empty ass to shake his ears
    and graze in commons
  octavius you may do your will
    but hes a tried and valiant soldier
  antony so is my horse octavius and for that
    i do appoint him store of provender
    it is a creature that i teach to fight
    to wind to stop to run directly on
    his corporal motion governd by my spirit
    and in some taste is lepidus but so
    he must be taught and traind and bid go forth
    a barrenspirited fellow one that feeds
    on objects arts and imitations
    which out of use and staled by other men
    begin his fashion do not talk of him
    but as a property and now octavius
    listen great things brutus and cassius
    are levying powers we must straight make head
    therefore let our alliance be combined
    our best friends made our means stretchd
    and let us presently go sit in council
    how covert matters may be best disclosed
    and open perils surest answered
  octavius let us do so for we are at the stake
    and bayd about with many enemies
    and some that smile have in their hearts i fear
    millions of mischiefs                               exeunt




scene ii
camp near sardis before brutus tent drum

enter brutus lucilius lucius and soldiers titinius and
pindarus meet them

  brutus stand ho
  lucilius give the word ho and stand
  brutus what now lucilius is cassius near
  lucilius he is at hand and pindarus is come
    to do you salutation from his master
  brutus he greets me well your master pindarus
    in his own change or by ill officers
    hath given me some worthy cause to wish
    things done undone but if he be at hand
    i shall be satisfied
  pindarus i do not doubt
    but that my noble master will appear
    such as he is full of regard and honor
  brutus he is not doubted a word lucilius
    how he received you let me be resolved
  lucilius with courtesy and with respect enough
    but not with such familiar instances
    nor with such free and friendly conference
    as he hath used of old
  brutus thou hast described
    a hot friend cooling ever note lucilius
    when love begins to sicken and decay
    it useth an enforced ceremony
    there are no tricks in plain and simple faith
    but hollow men like horses hot at hand
    make gallant show and promise of their mettle
    but when they should endure the bloody spur
    they fall their crests and like deceitful jades
    sink in the trial comes his army on
  lucilius they meant his night in sard is to be quarterd
    the greater part the horse in general
    are come with cassius                     low march within

  cassius most noble brother you have done me wrong
  brutus judge me you gods wrong i mine enemies
    and if not so how should i wrong a brother
  cassius brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs
    and when you do them
  brutus cassius be content
    speak your griefs softly i do know you well
    before the eyes of both our armies here
    which should perceive nothing but love from us
    let us not wrangle bid them move away
    then in my tent cassius enlarge your griefs
    and i will give you audience
  cassius pindarus
    bid our commanders lead their charges off
    a little from this ground
  brutus lucilius do you the like and let no man
    come to our tent till we have done our conference
    let lucius and titinius guard our door             exeunt




scene iii
brutus tent

enter brutus and cassius

  cassius that you have wrongd me doth appear in this
    you have condemnd and noted lucius pella
    for taking bribes here of the sardians
    wherein my letters praying on his side
    because i knew the man were slighted off
  brutus you wrongd yourself to write in such a case
  cassius in such a time as this it is not meet
    that every nice offense should bear his comment
  brutus let me tell you cassius you yourself
    are much condemnd to have an itching palm
    to sell and mart your offices for gold
    to undeservers
  cassius i an itching palm
    you know that you are brutus that speaks this
    or by the gods this speech were else your last
  brutus the name of cassius honors this corruption
    and chastisement doth therefore hide his head
  cassius chastisement
  brutus remember march the ides of march remember
    did not great julius bleed for justice sake
    what villain touchd his body that did stab
    and not for justice what shall one of us
    that struck the foremost man of all this world
    but for supporting robbers shall we now
    contaminate our fingers with base bribes
    and sell the mighty space of our large honors
    for so much trash as may be grasped thus
    i had rather be a dog and bay the moon
    than such a roman
  cassius brutus bait not me
    ill not endure it you forget yourself
    to hedge me in i am a soldier i
    older in practice abler than yourself
    to make conditions
  brutus go to you are not cassius
  cassius i am
  brutus i say you are not
  cassius urge me no more i shall forget myself
    have mind upon your health tempt me no farther
  brutus away slight man
  cassius ist possible
  brutus hear me for i will speak
    must i give way and room to your rash choler
    shall i be frighted when a madman stares
  cassius o gods ye gods must i endure all this
  brutus all this ay more fret till your proud heart break
    go show your slaves how choleric you are
    and make your bondmen tremble must i bouge
    must i observe you must i stand and crouch
    under your testy humor by the gods
    you shall digest the venom of your spleen
    though it do split you for from this day forth
    ill use you for my mirth yea for my laughter
    when you are waspish
  cassius is it come to this
  brutus you say you are a better soldier
    let it appear so make your vaunting true
    and it shall please me well for mine own part
    i shall be glad to learn of noble men
  cassius you wrong me every way you wrong me brutus
    i said an elder soldier not a better
    did i say better
  brutus if you did i care not
  cassius when caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me
  brutus peace peace you durst not so have tempted him
  cassius i durst not
  brutus no
  cassius what durst not tempt him
  brutus for your life you durst not
  cassius do not presume too much upon my love
    i may do that i shall be sorry for
  brutus you have done that you should be sorry for
    there is no terror cassius in your threats
    for i am armd so strong in honesty
    that they pass by me as the idle wind
    which i respect not i did send to you
    for certain sums of gold which you denied me
    for i can raise no money by vile means
    by heaven i had rather coin my heart
    and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
    from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
    by any indirection i did send
    to you for gold to pay my legions
    which you denied me was that done like cassius
    should i have answerd caius cassius so
    when marcus brutus grows so covetous
    to lock such rascal counters from his friends
    be ready gods with all your thunderbolts
    dash him to pieces
  cassius i denied you not
  brutus you did
  cassius i did not he was but a fool
    that brought my answer back brutus hath rived my heart
    a friend should bear his friends infirmities
    but brutus makes mine greater than they are
  brutus i do not till you practise them on me
  cassius you love me not
  brutus i do not like your faults
  cassius a friendly eye could never see such faults
  brutus a flatterers would not though they do appear
    as huge as high olympus
  cassius come antony and young octavius come
    revenge yourselves alone on cassius
    for cassius is aweary of the world
    hated by one he loves braved by his brother
    checkd like a bondman all his faults observed
    set in a notebook learnd and connd by rote
    to cast into my teeth o i could weep
    my spirit from mine eyes there is my dagger
    and here my naked breast within a heart
    dearer than plutos mine richer than gold
    if that thou best a roman take it forth
    i that denied thee gold will give my heart
    strike as thou didst at caesar for i know
    when thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better
    than ever thou lovedst cassius
  brutus sheathe your dagger
    be angry when you will it shall have scope
    do what you will dishonor shall be humor
    o cassius you are yoked with a lamb
    that carries anger as the flint bears fire
    who much enforced shows a hasty spark
    and straight is cold again
  cassius hath cassius lived
    to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus
    when grief and blood illtemperd vexeth him
  brutus when i spoke that i was illtemperd too
  cassius do you confess so much give me your hand
  brutus and my heart too
  cassius o brutus
  brutus whats the matter
  cassius have not you love enough to bear with me
    when that rash humor which my mother gave me
    makes me forgetful
  brutus yes cassius and from henceforth
    when you are overearnest with your brutus
    hell think your mother chides and leave you so
  poet within let me go in to see the generals
    there is some grudge between em tis not meet
    they be alone
  lucilius within you shall not come to them
  poet within nothing but death shall stay me

      enter poet followed by lucilius titinius and lucius

  cassius how now whats the matter
  poet for shame you generals what do you mean
    love and be friends as two such men should be
    for i have seen more years im sure than ye
  cassius ha ha how vilely doth this cynic rhyme
  brutus get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence
  cassius bear with him brutus tis his fashion
  brutus ill know his humor when he knows his time
    what should the wars do with these jigging fools
    companion hence
  cassius away away be gone                       exit poet
  brutus lucilius and titinius bid the commanders
    prepare to lodge their companies tonight
  cassius and come yourselves and bring messala with you
    immediately to us             exeunt lucilius and titinius
  brutus lucius a bowl of wine                   exit lucius
  cassius i did not think you could have been so angry
  brutus o cassius i am sick of many griefs
  cassius of your philosophy you make no use
    if you give place to accidental evils
  brutus no man bears sorrow better portia is dead
  cassius ha portia
  brutus she is dead
  cassius how scaped killing when i crossd you so
    o insupportable and touching loss
    upon what sickness
  brutus impatient of my absence
    and grief that young octavius with mark antony
    have made themselves so strong for with her death
    that tidings came with this she fell distract
    and her attendants absent swallowd fire
  cassius and died so
  brutus even so
  cassius o ye immortal gods

               reenter lucius with wine and taper

  brutus speak no more of her give me a bowl of wine
    in this i bury all unkindness cassius              drinks
  cassius my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge
  fill lucius till the wine oerswell the cup
  i cannot drink too much of brutus love               drinks
  brutus come in titinius                        exit lucius

                 reenter titinius with messala

    welcome good messala
    now sit we close about this taper here
    and call in question our necessities
  cassius portia art thou gone
  brutus no more i pray you
    messala i have here received letters
    that young octavius and mark antony
    come down upon us with a mighty power
    bending their expedition toward philippi
  messala myself have letters of the selfsame tenure
  brutus with what addition
  messala that by proscription and bills of outlawry
    octavius antony and lepidus
    have put to death an hundred senators
  brutus there in our letters do not well agree
    mine speak of seventy senators that died
    by their proscriptions cicero being one
  cassius cicero one
  messala cicero is dead
    and by that order of proscription
    had you your letters from your wife my lord
  brutus no messala
  messala nor nothing in your letters writ of her
  brutus nothing messala
  messala that methinks is strange
  brutus why ask you hear you aught of her in yours
  messala no my lord
  brutus now as you are a roman tell me true
  messala then like a roman bear the truth i tell
    for certain she is dead and by strange manner
  brutus why farewell portia we must die messala
    with meditating that she must die once
    i have the patience to endure it now
  messala even so great men great losses should endure
  cassius i have as much of this in art as you
    but yet my nature could not bear it so
  brutus well to our work alive what do you think
    of marching to philippi presently
  cassius i do not think it good
  brutus your reason
  cassius this it is
    tis better that the enemy seek us
    so shall he waste his means weary his soldiers
    doing himself offense whilst we lying still
    are full of rest defense and nimbleness
  brutus good reasons must of force give place to better
    the people twixt philippi and this ground
    do stand but in a forced affection
    for they have grudged us contribution
    the enemy marching along by them
    by them shall make a fuller number up
    come on refreshd newadded and encouraged
    from which advantage shall we cut him off
    if at philippi we do face him there
    these people at our back
  cassius hear me good brother
  brutus under your pardon you must note beside
    that we have tried the utmost of our friends
    our legions are brimfull our cause is ripe
    the enemy increaseth every day
    we at the height are ready to decline
    there is a tide in the affairs of men
    which taken at the flood leads on to fortune
    omitted all the voyage of their life
    is bound in shallows and in miseries
    on such a full sea are we now afloat
    and we must take the current when it serves
    or lose our ventures
  cassius then with your will go on
    well along ourselves and meet them at philippi
  brutus the deep of night is crept upon our talk
    and nature must obey necessity
    which we will niggard with a little rest
    there is no more to say
  cassius no more good night
    early tomorrow will we rise and hence
  brutus lucius

                       reenter lucius

act v scene i
the plains of philippi

enter octavius antony and their army

  octavius now antony our hopes are answered
    you said the enemy would not come down
    but keep the hills and upper regions
    it proves not so their battles are at hand
    they mean to warn us at philippi here
    answering before we do demand of them
  antony tut i am in their bosoms and i know
    wherefore they do it they could be content
    to visit other places and come down
    with fearful bravery thinking by this face
    to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage
    but tis not so

                    enter a messenger

  messenger prepare you generals
    the enemy comes on in gallant show
    their bloody sign of battle is hung out
    and something to be done immediately
  antony octavius lead your battle softly on
    upon the left hand of the even field
  octavius upon the right hand i keep thou the left
  antony why do you cross me in this exigent
  octavius i do not cross you but i will do so

      march drum enter brutus cassius and their army
           lucilius titinius messala and others

  brutus they stand and would have parley
  cassius stand fast titinius we must out and talk
  octavius mark antony shall we give sign of battle
  antony no caesar we will answer on their charge
    make forth the generals would have some words
  octavius stir not until the signal not until the signal
  brutus words before blows is it so countrymen
  octavius not that we love words better as you do
  brutus good words are better than bad strokes octavius
  antony in your bad strokes brutus you give good words
    witness the hole you made in caesars heart
    crying long live hail caesar
  cassius antony
    the posture of your blows are yet unknown
    but for your words they rob the hybla bees
    and leave them honeyless
  antony not stingless too
  brutus o yes and soundless too
    for you have stoln their buzzing antony
    and very wisely threat before you sting
  antony villains you did not so when your vile daggers
    hackd one another in the sides of caesar
    you showd your teeth like apes and fawnd like hounds
    and bowd like bondmen kissing caesars feet
    whilst damned casca like a cur behind
    strooke caesar on the neck o you flatterers
  cassius flatterers now brutus thank yourself
    this tongue had not offended so today
    if cassius might have ruled
  octavius come come the cause if arguing make us sweat
    the proof of it will turn to redder drops
    look
    i draw a sword against conspirators
    when think you that the sword goes up again
    never till caesars three and thirty wounds
    be well avenged or till another caesar
    have added slaughter to the sword of traitors
  brutus caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands
    unless thou bringst them with thee
  octavius so i hope
    i was not born to die on brutus sword
  brutus o if thou wert the noblest of thy strain
    young man thou couldst not die more honorable
  cassius a peevish school boy worthless of such honor
    joind with a masker and a reveler
  antony old cassius still
  octavius come antony away
    defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth
    if you dare fight today come to the field
    if not when you have stomachs
                        exeunt octavius antony and their army
  cassius why now blow and swell billow and swim bark
    the storm is up and all is on the hazard
  brutus ho lucilius hark a word with you
  lucilius stands forth my lord
                             brutus and lucilius converse apart
  cassius messala
  messala stands forth what says my general
  cassius messala
    this is my birthday as this very day
    was cassius born give me thy hand messala
    be thou my witness that against my will
    as pompey was am i compelld to set
    upon one battle all our liberties
    you know that i held epicurus strong
    and his opinion now i change my mind
    and partly credit things that do presage
    coming from sardis on our former ensign
    two mighty eagles fell and there they perchd
    gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands
    who to philippi here consorted us
    this morning are they fled away and gone
    and in their steads do ravens crows and kites
    fly oer our heads and downward look on us
    as we were sickly prey their shadows seem
    a canopy most fatal under which
    our army lies ready to give up the ghost
  messala believe not so
  cassius i but believe it partly
    for i am fresh of spirit and resolved
    to meet all perils very constantly
  brutus even so lucilius
  cassius now most noble brutus
    the gods today stand friendly that we may
    lovers in peace lead on our days to age
    but since the affairs of men rest still incertain
    lets reason with the worst that may befall
    if we do lose this battle then is this
    the very last time we shall speak together
    what are you then determined to do
  brutus even by the rule of that philosophy
    by which i did blame cato for the death
    which he did give himself i know not how
    but i do find it cowardly and vile
    for fear of what might fall so to prevent
    the time of life arming myself with patience
    to stay the providence of some high powers
    that govern us below
  cassius then if we lose this battle
    you are contented to be led in triumph
    thorough the streets of rome
  brutus no cassius no think not thou noble roman
    that ever brutus will go bound to rome
    he bears too great a mind but this same day
    must end that work the ides of march begun
    and whether we shall meet again i know not
    therefore our everlasting farewell take
    forever and forever farewell cassius
    if we do meet again why we shall smile
    if not why then this parting was well made
  cassius forever and forever farewell brutus
    if we do meet again well smile indeed
    if not tis true this parting was well made
  brutus why then lead on o that a man might know
    the end of this days business ere it come
    but it sufficeth that the day will end
    and then the end is known come ho away           exeunt




scene ii
the field of battle

alarum enter brutus and messala

  brutus ride ride messala ride and give these bills
    unto the legions on the other side             loud alarum
    let them set on at once for i perceive
    but cold demeanor in octavias wing
    and sudden push gives them the overthrow
    ride ride messala let them all come down         exeunt




scene iii
another part of the field

alarums enter cassius and titinius

  cassius o look titinius look the villains fly
    myself have to mine own turnd enemy
    this ensign here of mine was turning back
    i slew the coward and did take it from him
  titinius o cassius brutus gave the word too early
    who having some advantage on octavius
    took it too eagerly his soldiers fell to spoil
    whilst we by antony are all enclosed

                       enter pindarus

    till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
    and here again that i may rest assured

  titinius i will be here again even with a thought     exit
  cassius go pindarus get higher on that hill
    my sight was ever thick regard titinius
    and tell me what thou notest about the field
                                      pindarus ascends the hill
    this day i breathed first time is come round
    and where i did begin there shall i end
    my life is run his compass sirrah what news

  pindarus above titinius is enclosed round about
    with horsemen that make to him on the spur

    now titinius now some light o he lights too
    hes taen shout and hark they shout for joy
  cassius come down behold no more
    o coward that i am to live so long
    to see my best friend taen before my face
                                              pindarus descends
    come hither sirrah
    in parthia did i take thee prisoner
    and then i swore thee saving of thy life
    that whatsoever i did bid thee do
    thou shouldst attempt it come now keep thine oath
    now be a freeman and with this good sword
    that ran through caesars bowels search this bosom
    stand not to answer here take thou the hilts
    and when my face is coverd as tis now
    guide thou the sword pindarus stabs him caesar thou art
      revenged
    even with the sword that killd thee                  dies

                reenter titinius with messala

  messala it is but change titinius for octavius
    is overthrown by noble brutus power
    as cassius legions are by antony
  titinius these tidings would well comfort cassius
  messala where did you leave him
  titinius all disconsolate
    with pindarus his bondman on this hill
  messala is not that he that lies upon the ground
  titinius he lies not like the living o my heart
  messala is not that he
  titinius no this was he messala
    but cassius is no more o setting sun
    as in thy red rays thou dost sink to night
    so in his red blood cassius day is set
    the sun of rome is set our day is gone
    clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done
    mistrust of my success hath done this deed
  messala mistrust of good success hath done this deed
    o hateful error melancholys child
    why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
    the things that are not o error soon conceived
    thou never comest unto a happy birth
    but killst the mother that engenderd thee
  titinius what pindarus where art thou pindarus
  messala seek him titinius whilst i go to meet
    the noble brutus thrusting this report
    into his ears i may say thrusting it
    for piercing steel and darts envenomed
    shall be as welcome to the ears of brutus
    as tidings of this sight
  titinius hie you messala
    and i will seek for pindarus the while        exit messala
    why didst thou send me forth brave cassius
    did i not meet thy friends and did not they
    put on my brows this wreath of victory
    and bid me give it thee didst thou not hear their shouts
    alas thou hast misconstrued everything
    but hold thee take this garland on thy brow
    thy brutus bid me give it thee and i
    will do his bidding brutus come apace
    and see how i regarded caius cassius
    by your leave gods this is a romans part
    come cassius sword and find titinius heart
                                                  kills himself

    should breed thy fellow friends i owe moe tears
    to this dead man than you shall see me pay
    i shall find time cassius i shall find time
    come therefore and to thasos send his body
    his funerals shall not be in our camp
    lest it discomfort us lucilius come
    and come young cato let us to the field

  strato i held the sword and he did run on it
  messala octavius then take him to follow thee
    that did the latest service to my master
  antony this was the noblest roman of them all
    all the conspirators save only he
    did that they did in envy of great caesar
    he only in a general honest thought
    and common good to all made one of them
    his life was gentle and the elements
    so mixd in him that nature might stand up
    and say to all the world this was a man
  octavius according to his virtue let us use him
    with all respect and rites of burial
    within my tent his bones tonight shall lie
    most like a soldier ordered honorably
    so call the field to rest and lets away
    to part the glories of this happy day              exeunt

november 1998 etext 1513


project gutenberg etext of romeo and juliet by shakespeare
this file should be named 1513txt or 1513zip


this etext was prepared by the pg shakespeare team
a team of about twenty project gutenberg volunteers


project gutenberg etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the public domain in the united states unless a
copyright notice is included  therefore we usually do not keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


we are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

please note  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
the official release date of all project gutenberg etexts is at
midnight central time of the last day of the stated month  a
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so  to be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month  since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


information about project gutenberg one page

we produce about two million dollars for each hour we work  the
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc  this
projected audience is one hundred million readers  if our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
if these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion etexts given away this year

the goal of project gutenberg is to give away one trillion etext
files by december 31 2001  10000 x 100000000  1 trillion
this is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

at our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from michael harts salary at carnegiemellon university and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want project gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

chor
two households both alike in dignity
  in fair verona where we lay our scene
from ancient grudge break to new mutiny
  where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
from forth the fatal loins of these two foes
  a pair of starcrossd lovers take their life
whose misadventurd piteous overthrows
  doth with their death bury their parents strife
the fearful passage of their deathmarkd love
  and the continuance of their parents rage
which but their childrens end naught could remove
  is now the two hours traffic of our stage
the which if you with patient ears attend
what here shall miss our toil shall strive to mend

lady montague
o where is romeosaw you him today
right glad i am he was not at this fray

benvolio
madam an hour before the worshippd sun
peerd forth the golden window of the east
a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad
whereunderneath the grove of sycamore
that westward rooteth from the citys side
so early walking did i see your son
towards him i made but he was ware of me
and stole into the covert of the wood
i measuring his affections by my own
that most are busied when theyre most alone
pursud my humour not pursuing his
and gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me

montague
many a morning hath he there been seen
with tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew
adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
but all so soon as the allcheering sun
should in the farthest east begin to draw
the shady curtains from auroras bed
away from light steals home my heavy son
and private in his chamber pens himself
shuts up his windows locks fair daylight out
and makes himself an artificial night
black and portentous must this humour prove
unless good counsel may the cause remove

benvolio
my noble uncle do you know the cause

montague
i neither know it nor can learn of him

benvolio
have you importund him by any means

montague
both by myself and many other friends
but he his own affections counsellor
is to himselfi will not say how true
but to himself so secret and so close
so far from sounding and discovery
as is the bud bit with an envious worm
ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
or dedicate his beauty to the sun
could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
we would as willingly give cure as know

benvolio
see where he comes so please you step aside
ill know his grievance or be much denied

montague
i would thou wert so happy by thy stay
to hear true shriftcome madam lets away

romeo
out

benvolio
of love

romeo
out of her favour where i am in love

benvolio
alas that love so gentle in his view
should be so tyrannous and rough in proof

romeo
alas that love whose view is muffled still
should without eyes see pathways to his will
where shall we dineo mewhat fray was here
yet tell me not for i have heard it all
heres much to do with hate but more with love
why then o brawling love o loving hate
o anything of nothing first create
o heavy lightness serious vanity
misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms
feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health
stillwaking sleep that is not what it is
this love feel i that feel no love in this
dost thou not laugh

benvolio
no coz i rather weep

romeo
good heart at what

benvolio
at thy good hearts oppression

romeo
why such is loves transgression
griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast
which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
with more of thine this love that thou hast shown
doth add more grief to too much of mine own
love is a smoke raisd with the fume of sighs
being purgd a fire sparkling in lovers eyes
being vexd a sea nourishd with lovers tears
what is it else a madness most discreet
a choking gall and a preserving sweet
farewell my coz

going

benvolio
soft i will go along
an if you leave me so you do me wrong

romeo
tut i have lost myself i am not here

and in strong proof of chastity well armd
from loves weak childish bow she lives unharmd
she will not stay the siege of loving terms
nor bide th encounter of assailing eyes
nor ope her lap to saintseducing gold
o shes rich in beauty only poor
that when she dies with beauty dies her store

benvolio
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste

romeo
she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste
for beauty starvd with her severity
cuts beauty off from all posterity
she is too fair too wise wisely too fair
to merit bliss by making me despair
she hath forsworn to love and in that vow
do i live dead that live to tell it now

benvolio
be ruld by me forget to think of her

romeo
o teach me how i should forget to think

benvolio
by giving liberty unto thine eyes
examine other beauties

romeo
tis the way
to call hers exquisite in question more
these happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows
being black puts us in mind they hide the fair
he that is strucken blind cannot forget
the precious treasure of his eyesight lost
show me a mistress that is passing fair
what doth her beauty serve but as a note
where i may read who passd that passing fair
farewell thou canst not teach me to forget

ill pay that doctrine or else die in debt

this precious book of love this unbound lover
to beautify him only lacks a cover
the fish lives in the sea and tis much pride
for fair without the fair within to hide
that book in manys eyes doth share the glory
that in gold clasps locks in the golden story
so shall you share all that he doth possess
by having him making yourself no less

nurse

scene iv a street

enter romeo mercutio benvolio with five or six maskers
torchbearers and others

romeo
what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
or shall we on without apology

benvolio
the date is out of such prolixity
well have no cupid hoodwinkd with a scarf
bearing a tartars painted bow of lath
scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper
nor no withoutbook prologue faintly spoke
after the prompter for our entrance
but let them measure us by what they will
well measure them a measure and be gone

romeo
give me a torchi am not for this ambling
being but heavy i will bear the light

mercutio
nay gentle romeo we must have you dance

romeo
not i believe me you have dancing shoes
with nimble soles i have a soul of lead
so stakes me to the ground i cannot move

mercutio
you are a lover borrow cupids wings
and soar with them above a common bound

romeo
i am too sore enpierced with his shaft
to soar with his light feathers and so bound
i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
under loves heavy burden do i sink

mercutio
and to sink in it should you burden love
too great oppression for a tender thing

romeo
is love a tender thing  it is too rough
too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn

mercutio
if love be rough with you be rough with love
prick love for pricking and you beat love down
give me a case to put my visage in putting on a mask
a visard for a visard  what care i
what curious eye doth quote deformities
here are the beetlebrows shall blush for me

benvolio
come knock and enter and no sooner in
but every man betake him to his legs

romeo
a torch for me let wantons light of heart
tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
for i am proverbd with a grandsire phrase
ill be a candleholder and look on
the game was neer so fair and i am done

mercutio
tut duns the mouse the constables own word
if thou art dun well draw thee from the mire
of thissirreverencelove wherein thou stickst
up to the earscome we burn daylight ho

romeo
nay thats not so

mercutio
i mean sir in delay
we waste our lights in vain like lamps by day
take our good meaning for our judgment sits
five times in that ere once in our five wits

romeo
and we mean well in going to this mask
but tis no wit to go

mercutio
why may one ask

romeo
i dreamt a dream tonight

mercutio
and so did i

romeo
well what was yours

mercutio
that dreamers often lie

romeo
in bed asleep while they do dream things true

mercutio
o then i see queen mab hath been with you
she is the fairies midwife and she comes
in shape no bigger than an agatestone
on the forefinger of an alderman
drawn with a team of little atomies
athwart mens noses as they lie asleep
her waggonspokes made of long spinners legs
the cover of the wings of grasshoppers
the traces of the smallest spiders web
the collars of the moonshines watery beams
her whip of crickets bone the lash of film
her waggoner a small greycoated gnat
not half so big as a round little worm
prickd from the lazy finger of a maid
her chariot is an empty hazelnut
made by the joiner squirrel or old grub
time out o mind the fairies coachmakers
and in this state she gallops night by night
through lovers brains and then they dream of love
oer courtiers knees that dream on courtsies straight
oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees
oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream
which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues
because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose
and then dreams he of smelling out a suit
and sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail
tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep
then dreams he of another benefice
sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck
and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades
of healths five fathom deep and then anon
drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
and sleeps again this is that very mab
that plats the manes of horses in the night
and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs
which once untangled much misfortune bodes
this is the hag when maids lie on their backs
that presses them and learns them first to bear
making them women of good carriage
this is she

romeo
peace peace mercutio peace
thou talkst of nothing

mercutio
true i talk of dreams
which are the children of an idle brain
begot of nothing but vain fantasy
which is as thin of substance as the air
and more inconstant than the wind who wooes
even now the frozen bosom of the north
and being angerd puffs away from thence
turning his face to the dewdropping south

benvolio
this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
supper is done and we shall come too late

romeo
i fear too early for my mind misgives
some consequence yet hanging in the stars
shall bitterly begin his fearful date
with this nights revels and expire the term
of a despised life closd in my breast
by some vile forfeit of untimely death
but he that hath the steerage of my course
direct my sailon lusty gentlemen

romeo
what lady is that which doth enrich the hand
of yonder knight

servant
i know not sir

romeo
o she doth teach the torches to burn bright
it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
like a rich jewel in an ethiops ear
beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
as yonder lady oer her fellows shows
the measure done ill watch her place of stand
and touching hers make blessed my rude hand
did my heart love till now  forswear it sight
for i neer saw true beauty till this night

tybalt
this by his voice should be a montague
fetch me my rapier boywhat dares the slave
come hither coverd with an antic face
to fleer and scorn at our solemnity
now by the stock and honour of my kin
to strike him dead i hold it not a sin

capulet
why how now kinsman wherefore storm you so

tybalt

a villain that is hither come in spite
to scorn at our solemnity this night

capulet

tybalt

capulet
content thee gentle coz let him alone
he bears him like a portly gentleman
and to say truth verona brags of him
to be a virtuous and wellgovernd youth
i would not for the wealth of all the town
here in my house do him disparagement
therefore be patient take no note of him
it is my will the which if thou respect
show a fair presence and put off these frowns
an illbeseeming semblance for a feast

tybalt

romeo
to juliet if i profane with my unworthiest hand
  this holy shrine the gentle fine is this
my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand
  to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss

juliet
good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much
  which mannerly devotion shows in this
for saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch
  and palm to palm is holy palmers kiss

romeo
have not saints lips and holy palmers too

juliet
ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer

romeo
o then dear saint let lips do what hands do
they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair

juliet
saints do not move though grant for prayers sake

romeo
then move not while my prayers effect i take
thus from my lips by thine my sin is purgd
kissing her

juliet
then have my lips the sin that they have took

romeo
sin from my lips  o trespass sweetly urgd

enter chorus

chorus
now old desire doth in his deathbed lie
  and young affection gapes to be his heir
that fair for which love groand for and would die
  with tender juliet matchd is now not fair
now romeo is belovd and loves again
  alike bewitched by the charm of looks
but to his foe supposd he must complain
  and she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks
being held a foe he may not have access
  to breathe such vows as lovers usd to swear
and she as much in love her means much less
  to meet her new beloved anywhere
but passion lends them power time means to meet
  tempering extremities with extreme sweet

scene i an open place adjoining capulets garden

enter romeo

romeo
can i go forward when my heart is here
turn back dull earth and find thy centre out

he climbs the wall and leaps down within it

enter benvolio and mercutio

benvolio
romeo my cousin romeo

mercutio
he is wise
and on my life hath stoln him home to bed

benvolio
he ran this way and leapd this orchard wall
call good mercutio

mercutio
nay ill conjure too
romeo humours madman passion lover
appear thou in the likeness of a sigh
speak but one rhyme and i am satisfied
cry but ah me pronounce but love and dove
speak to my gossip venus one fair word
one nickname for her purblind son and heir
young auburn cupid he that shot so trim
when king cophetua lovd the beggarmaid
he heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not
the ape is dead and i must conjure him
i conjure thee by rosalines bright eyes
by her high forehead and her scarlet lip
by her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh
and the demesnes that there adjacent lie
that in thy likeness thou appear to us

benvolio
an if he hear thee thou wilt anger him

mercutio
this cannot anger him twould anger him
to raise a spirit in his mistress circle
of some strange nature letting it there stand
till she had laid it and conjurd it down
that were some spite my invocation
is fair and honest and in his mistress name
i conjure only but to raise up him

benvolio
come he hath hid himself among these trees
to be consorted with the humorous night
blind is his love and best befits the dark

mercutio
if love be blind love cannot hit the mark
now will he sit under a medlar tree
and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
as maids call medlars when they laugh alone
romeo good nightill to my trucklebed
this fieldbed is too cold for me to sleep
come shall we go

benvolio
go then for tis in vain
to seek him here that means not to be found

exeunt



scene ii capulets garden

enter romeo

romeo
he jests at scars that never felt a wound
juliet appears above at a window
but soft what light through yonder window breaks
it is the east and juliet is the sun
arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
who is already sick and pale with grief
that thou her maid art far more fair than she
be not her maid since she is envious
her vestal livery is but sick and green
and none but fools do wear it cast it off
it is my lady o it is my love
o that she knew she were
she speaks yet she says nothing what of that
her eye discourses i will answer it
i am too bold tis not to me she speaks
two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
having some business do entreat her eyes
to twinkle in their spheres till they return
what if her eyes were there they in her head
the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
as daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
would through the airy region stream so bright
that birds would sing and think it were not night
see how she leans her cheek upon her hand
o that i were a glove upon that hand
that i might touch that cheek

juliet
ah me

romeo
she speaks
o speak again bright angel for thou art
as glorious to this night being oer my head
as is a winged messenger of heaven
unto the whiteupturned wondering eyes
of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
when he bestrides the lazypacing clouds
and sails upon the bosom of the air

juliet
o romeo romeo wherefore art thou romeo
deny thy father and refuse thy name
or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
and ill no longer be a capulet

romeo
aside shall i hear more or shall i speak at this

juliet
tis but thy name that is my enemy
thou art thyself though not a montague
whats montague it is nor hand nor foot
nor arm nor face nor any other part
belonging to a man o be some other name
whats in a name that which we call a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet
so romeo would were he not romeo calld
retain that dear perfection which he owes
without that titleromeo doff thy name
and for that name which is no part of thee
take all myself

romeo
i take thee at thy word
call me but love and ill be new baptizd
henceforth i never will be romeo

juliet
what man art thou that thus bescreend in night
so stumblest on my counsel

romeo
by a name
i know not how to tell thee who i am
my name dear saint is hateful to myself
because it is an enemy to thee
had i it written i would tear the word

juliet
my ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
of that tongues utterance yet i know the sound
art thou not romeo and a montague

romeo
neither fair saint if either thee dislike

juliet
how camst thou hither tell me and wherefore
the orchard walls are high and hard to climb
and the place death considering who thou art
if any of my kinsmen find thee here

romeo
with loves light wings did i oerperch these walls
for stony limits cannot hold love out
and what love can do that dares love attempt
therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me

juliet
if they do see thee they will murder thee

romeo
alack there lies more peril in thine eye
than twenty of their swords look thou but sweet
and i am proof against their enmity

juliet
i would not for the world they saw thee here

romeo
i have nights cloak to hide me from their sight
and but thou love me let them find me here
my life were better ended by their hate
than death prorogued wanting of thy love

juliet
by whose direction foundst thou out this place

romeo
by love that first did prompt me to enquire
he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes
i am no pilot yet wert thou as far
as that vast shore washd with the furthest sea
i would adventure for such merchandise

juliet
thou knowest the mask of night is on my face
else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
fain would i dwell on formfain fain deny
what i have spoke but farewell compliment
dost thou love me i know thou wilt say ay
and i will take thy word yet if thou swearst
thou mayst prove false at lovers perjuries
they say jove laughs  o gentle romeo
if thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
or if thou thinkest i am too quickly won
ill frown and be perverse and say thee nay
so thou wilt woo but else not for the world
in truth fair montague i am too fond
and therefore thou mayst think my haviour light
but trust me gentleman ill prove more true
than those that have more cunning to be strange
i should have been more strange i must confess
but that thou overheardst ere i was ware
my truelove passion therefore pardon me
and not impute this yielding to light love
which the dark night hath so discovered

romeo
lady by yonder blessed moon i swear
that tips with silver all these fruittree tops

juliet
o swear not by the moon the inconstant moon
that monthly changes in her circled orb
lest that thy love prove likewise variable

romeo
what shall i swear by

juliet
do not swear at all
or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self
which is the god of my idolatry
and ill believe thee

romeo
if my hearts dear love

juliet
well do not swear although i joy in thee
i have no joy of this contract tonight
it is too rash too unadvisd too sudden
too like the lightning which doth cease to be
ere one can say it lightens  sweet good night
this bud of love by summers ripening breath
may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
good night good night  as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart as that within my breast

romeo
o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied

juliet
what satisfaction canst thou have tonight

romeo
the exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine

juliet
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it
and yet i would it were to give again

romeo
wouldst thou withdraw it  for what purpose love

juliet
but to be frank and give it thee again
and yet i wish but for the thing i have
my bounty is as boundless as the sea
my love as deep  the more i give to thee
the more i have for both are infinite
i hear some noise within dear love adieu
nurse calls within
anon good nursesweet montague be true
stay but a little i will come again

romeo
o blessed blessed night i am afeard
being in night all this is but a dream

juliet
a thousand times good night

exit

romeo
a thousand times the worse to want thy light
love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books
but love from love towards school with heavy looks

retirong slowly

reenter juliet above

juliet
hist romeo histo for a falconers voice
to lure this tasselgentle back again
bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud
else would i tear the cave where echo lies
and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
with repetition of my romeos name

romeo
it is my soul that calls upon my name
how silversweet sound lovers tongues by night
like softest music to attending ears

juliet
romeo

romeo
my dear

juliet
at what oclock tomorrow
shall i send to thee

romeo
at the hour of nine

juliet
i will not fail tis twenty years till then
i have forgot why i did call thee back

romeo
let me stand here till thou remember it

juliet
i shall forget to have thee still stand there
remembering how i love thy company

romeo
and ill still stay to have thee still forget
forgetting any other home but this

juliet
tis almost morning i would have thee gone
and yet no farther than a wantons bird
that lets it hop a little from her hand
like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves
and with a silk thread plucks it back again
so lovingjealous of his liberty

romeo
i would i were thy bird

juliet
sweet so would i
yet i should kill thee with much cherishing
good night good night  parting is such sweet sorrow
that i shall say good night till it be morrow

exit

romeo
sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast
would i were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
hence will i to my ghostly fathers cell
his help to crave and my dear hap to tell

scene iii friar lawrences cell

enter friar lawrence with a basket

friar
the greyeyd morn smiles on the frowning night
chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light
and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
from forth days path and titans fiery wheels
non ere the sun advance his burning eye
the day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry
i must upfill this osier cage of ours
with baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers
the earth thats natures mother is her tomb
what is her burying gave that is her womb
and from her womb children of divers kind
we sucking on her natural bosom find
many for many virtues excellent
none but for some and yet all different
o mickle is the powerful grace that lies
in plants herbs stones and their true qualities
for naught so vile that on the earth doth live
but to the earth some special good doth give
nor aught so good but straind from that fair use
revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
virtue itself turns vice being misapplied
and vice sometimes by action dignified
within the infant rind of this small flower
poison hath residence and medicine power
for this being smelt with that part cheers each part
being tasted slays all senses with the heart
two such opposed kings encamp them still
in man as well as herbsgrace and rude will
and where the worser is predominant
full soon the canker death eats up that plant

enter romeo

romeo
good morrow father

friar
benedicite
what early tongue so sweet saluteth me
young son it argues a distemperd head
so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
care keeps his watch in every old mans eye
and where care lodges sleep will never lie
but where unbruised youth with unstuffd brain
doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
therefore thy earliness doth me assure
thou art uprousd with some distemperature
or if not so then here i hit it right
our romeo hath not been in bed tonight

romeo
that last is true the sweeter rest was mine

friar
god pardon sin wast thou with rosaline

romeo
with rosaline my ghostly father no
i have forgot that name and that names woe

friar
thats my good son but where hast thou been then

romeo
ill tell thee ere thou ask it me again
i have been feasting with mine enemy
where on a sudden one hath wounded me
thats by me wounded both our remedies
within thy help and holy physic lies
i bear no hatred blessed man for lo
my intercession likewise steads my foe

friar
be plain good son and homely in thy drift
riddling confession finds but riddling shrift

romeo
then plainly know my hearts dear love is set
on the fair daughter of rich capulet
as mine on hers so hers is set on mine
and all combind save what thou must combine
by holy marriage when and where and how
we met we wood and made exchange of vow
ill tell thee as we pass but this i pray
that thou consent to marry us today

friar
holy saint francis what a change is here
is rosaline that thou didst love so dear
so soon forsaken young mens love then lies
not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
jesu maria what a deal of brine
hath washd thy sallow cheeks for rosaline
how much salt water thrown away in waste
to season love that of it doth not taste
the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears
thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears
lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
of an old tear that is not washd off yet
if eer thou wast thyself and these woes thine
thou and these woes were all for rosaline
and art thou changd pronounce this sentence then
women may fall when theres no strength in men

romeo
thou chiddst me oft for loving rosaline

friar
for doting not for loving pupil mine

romeo
and badst me bury love

friar
not in a grave
to lay one in another out to have

romeo
i pray thee chide not she whom i love now
doth grace for grace and love for love allow
the other did not so

friar
o she knew well
thy love did read by rote that could not spell
but come young waverer come go with me
in one respect ill thy assistant be
for this alliance may so happy prove
to turn your households rancour to pure love

romeo
o let us hence i stand on sudden haste

wenchs black eye shot through the ear with a love song the
very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bowboys buttshaft
and is he a man to encounter tybalt

courageous captain of compliments he fights as you sing

mercutio

romeo
pardon good mercutio my business was great and in such a
case as mine a man may strain courtesy

man to bow in the hams

mercutio
thou hast most kindly hit it

romeo

narrow to an ell broad

great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble
in a hole

friar
so smile the heavens upon this holy act
that afterhours with sorrow chide us not

romeo
amen amen  but come what sorrow can
it cannot countervail the exchange of joy
that one short minute gives me in her sight
do thou but close our hands with holy words
then lovedevouring death do what he dare
it is enough i may but call her mine

friar
these violent delights have violent ends
and in their triumph die like fire and powder
which as they kiss consume the sweetest honey
is loathsome in his own deliciousness
and in the taste confounds the appetite
therefore love moderately long love doth so
too swift arrives as tardy as too slow
here comes the ladyo so light a foot
will neer wear out the everlasting flint
a lover may bestride the gossamer
that idles in the wanton summer air
and yet not fall so light is vanity

as much to him else is his thanks too much

romeo
ah juliet if the measure of thy joy
be heapd like mine and that thy skill be more
to blazon it then sweeten with thy breath
this neighbour air and let rich musics tongue
unfold the imagind happiness that both
receive in either by this dear encounter

juliet
conceit more rich in matter than in words
brags of his substance not of ornament
they are but beggars that can count their worth
but my true love is grown to such excess
i cannot sum up sum of half my wealth

friar
come come with me and we will make short work
for by your leaves you shall not stay alone
till holy church incorporate two in one

confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says
god send me no need of thee and by the operation of the second
cup draws him on the drawer when indeed there is no need

benvolio

one would kill the other  thou why thou wilt quarrel with a
man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou
hast thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyeswhat eye but such
an eye would spy out such a quarrel  thy head is as full of
quarrels as an egg is full of meat and yet thy head hath been
beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling  thou hast quarrelled
with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened
thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun  didst thou not fall
out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before easter with
another for tying his new shoes with an old riband and yet thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelling

benvolio

benvolio who began this bloody fray

benvolio
tybalt here slain whom romeos hand did slay
romeo that spoke him fair bid him bethink
how nice the quarrel was and urgd withal
your high displeasureall thisuttered
with gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowd
could not take truce with the unruly spleen
of tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts
with piercing steel at bold mercutios breast
who all as hot turns deadly point to point
and with a martial scorn with one hand beats
cold death aside and with the other sends
it back to tybalt whose dexterity
retorts it romeo he cries aloud
hold friends friends part and swifter than his tongue
his agile arm beats down their fatal points
and twixt them rushes underneath whose arm
an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life
of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled
but byandby comes back to romeo
who had but newly entertaind revenge
and tot they go like lightning for ere i
could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain
and as he fell did romeo turn and fly
this is the truth or let benvolio die

lady capulet
he is a kinsman to the montague
affection makes him false he speaks not true
some twenty of them fought in this black strife
and all those twenty could but kill one life
i beg for justice which thou prince must give
romeo slew tybalt romeo must not live

prince
romeo slew him he slew mercutio
who now the price of his dear blood doth owe

montague
not romeo prince he was mercutios friend
his fault concludes but what the law should end
the life of tybalt

prince
and for that offence
immediately we do exile him hence
i have an interest in your hates proceeding
my blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding
but ill amerce you with so strong a fine
that you shall all repent the loss of mine
i will be deaf to pleading and excuses
nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
therefore use none let romeo hence in haste
else when he is found that hour is his last
bear hence this body and attend our will
mercy but murders pardoning those that kill

but not possessd it and though i am sold
not yet enjoyd so tedious is this day

this torture should be roard in dismal hell
hath romeo slain himself say thou but i

i am not i if there be such an i
or those eyes shut that make thee answer i
if he be slain say i or if not no
brief sounds determine of my weal or woe

god save the markhere on his manly breast
a piteous corse a bloody piteous corse
pale pale as ashes all bedaubd in blood
all in gorebloodi swounded at the sight

juliet
o break my heartpoor bankrout break at once
to prison eyes neer look on liberty
vile earth to earth resign end motion here
and thou and romeo press one heavy bier

o tybalt tybalt the best friend i had
o courteous tybalt honest gentleman
that ever i should live to see thee dead

what storm is this that blows so contrary
is romeo slaughterd and is tybalt dead
my dearlovd cousin and my dearer lord
then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom
for who is living if those two are gone

tybalt is gone and romeo banished

did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
beautiful tyrant fiend angelical
dovefeatherd raven wolvishravening lamb
despised substance of divinest show
just opposite to what thou justly seemst
a damned saint an honourable villain
o nature what hadst thou to do in hell
when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
in mortal paradise of such sweet flesh
was ever book containing such vile matter
so fairly bound  o that deceit should dwell
in such a gorgeous palace

nurse
theres no trust
no faith no honesty in men all perjurd
all forsworn all naught all dissemblers
ah wheres my man  give me some aqua vitae
these griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
shame come to romeo

juliet
blisterd be thy tongue
for such a wish he was not born to shame
upon his brow shame is ashamd to sit
for tis a throne where honour may be crownd
sole monarch of the universal earth
o what a beast was i to chide at him

nurse
will you speak well of him that killd your cousin

juliet
shall i speak ill of him that is my husband
ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name
when i thy threehours wife have mangled it
but wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
that villain cousin would have killd my husband
back foolish tears back to your native spring
your tributary drops belong to woe
which you mistaking offer up to joy
my husband lives that tybalt would have slain
and tybalts dead that would have slain my husband
all this is comfort wherefore weep i then
some word there was worser than tybalts death
that murderd me i would forget it fain
but o it presses to my memory
like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds
tybalt is dead and romeo banished
that banished that one word banished
hath slain ten thousand tybalts  tybalts death
was woe enough if it had ended there
or if sour woe delights in fellowship
and needly will be rankd with other griefs
why followd not when she said tybalts dead
thy father or thy mother nay or both
which modern lamentation might have movd
but with a rearward following tybalts death
romeo is banishedto speak that word
is father mother tybalt romeo juliet
all slain all dead romeo is banished
there is no end no limit measure bound
in that words death no words can that woe sound
where is my father and my mother nurse

weeping and wailing over tybalts corse
will you go to them  i will bring you thither

is death mistermd calling death banishment
thou cuttst my head off with a golden axe
and smilst upon the stroke that murders me

friar
o deadly sin o rude unthankfulness
thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince
taking thy part hath brushd aside the law
and turnd that black word death to banishment
this is dear mercy and thou seest it not

romeo
tis torture and not mercy heaven is here
where juliet lives and every cat and dog
and little mouse every unworthy thing
live here in heaven and may look on her
but romeo may notmore validity
more honourable state more courtship lives
in carrion flies than romeo they may seize
on the white wonder of dear juliets hand
and steal immortal blessing from her lips
who even in pure and vestal modesty
still blush as thinking their own kisses sin
but romeo may not he is banished
this may flies do when i from this must fly
and sayest thou yet that exile is not death
hadst thou no poison mixd no sharpground knife
no sudden mean of death though neer so mean
but banished to kill me banished
o friar the damned use that word in hell
howlings attend it how hast thou the heart
being a divine a ghostly confessor
a sinabsolver and my friend professd
to mangle me with that word banishment

friar
thou fond mad man hear me speak a little

romeo
o thou wilt speak again of banishment

friar
ill give thee armour to keep off that word
adversitys sweet milk philosophy
to comfort thee though thou art banished

romeo
yet banished hang up philosophy
unless philosophy can make a juliet
displant a town reverse a princes doom
it helps not it prevails nottalk no more

friar
o then i see that madmen have no ears

romeo
how should they when that wise men have no eyes

friar
let me dispute with thee of thy estate

romeo
thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
wert thou as young as i juliet thy love
an hour but married tybalt murdered
doting like me and like me banished
then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair
and fall upon the ground as i do now
taking the measure of an unmade grave

knocking within

friar
arise one knocks good romeo hide thyself

romeo
not i unless the breath of heartsick groans
mistlike infold me from the search of eyes

romeo
nurse

nurse
ah sir ah sirwell deaths the end of all

romeo
spakest thou of juliet how is it with her
doth not she think me an old murderer
now i have staind the childhood of our joy
with blood removd but little from her own
where is she and how doth she and what says
my conceald lady to our cancelld love

nurse
o she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps
and now falls on her bed and then starts up
and tybalt calls and then on romeo cries
and then down falls again

romeo
as if that name
shot from the deadly level of a gun
did murder her as that names cursed hand
murderd her kinsmano tell me friar tell me
in what vile part of this anatomy
doth my name lodge tell me that i may sack
the hateful mansion

drawing his sword

friar
hold thy desperate hand
art thou a man thy form cries out thou art
thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote
the unreasonable fury of a beast
unseemly woman in a seeming man
or illbeseeming beast in seeming both
thou hast amazd me by my holy order
i thought thy disposition better temperd
hast thou slain tybalt wilt thou slay thyself
and slay thy lady too that lives in thee
by doing damned hate upon thyself
why railst thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
in thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
fie fie thou shamst thy shape thy love thy wit
which like a usurer aboundst in all
and usest none in that true use indeed
which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
thy noble shape is but a form of wax
digressing from the valour of a man
thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury
killing that love which thou hast vowd to cherish
thy wit that ornament to shape and love
misshapen in the conduct of them both
like powder in a skilless soldiers flask
is set afire by thine own ignorance
and thou dismemberd with thine own defence
what rouse thee man thy juliet is alive
for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead
there art thou happy tybalt would kill thee
but thou slewest tybalt there art thou happy too
the law that threatend death becomes thy friend
and turns it to exile there art thou happy
a pack of blessings lights upon thy back
happiness courts thee in her best array
but like a misbehavd and sullen wench
thou poutst upon thy fortune and thy love
take heed take heed for such die miserable
go get thee to thy love as was decreed
ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
but look thou stay not till the watch be set
for then thou canst not pass to mantua
where thou shalt live till we can find a time
to blaze your marriage reconcile your friends
beg pardon of the prince and call thee back
with twenty hundred thousand times more joy
than thou wentst forth in lamentation
go before nurse commend me to thy lady
and bid her hasten all the house to bed
which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
romeo is coming

nurse
o lord i could have stayd here all the night
to hear good counsel o what learning is
my lord ill tell my lady you will come

romeo
do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide

nurse
here sir a ring she bid me give you sir
hie you make haste for it grows very late

exit

romeo
how well my comfort is revivd by this

friar
go hence good night and here stands all your state
either be gone before the watch be set
or by the break of day disguisd from hence
sojourn in mantua ill find out your man
and he shall signify from time to time
every good hap to you that chances here
give me thy hand tis late farewell good night

romeo
but that a joy past joy calls out on me
it were a grief so brief to part with thee
farewell

garden

enter romeo and juliet

juliet
wilt thou be gone it is not yet near day
it was the nightingale and not the lark
that piercd the fearful hollow of thine ear
nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree
believe me love it was the nightingale

romeo
it was the lark the herald of the morn
no nightingale look love what envious streaks
do lace the severing clouds in yonder east
nights candles are burnt out and jocund day
stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
i must be gone and live or stay and die

juliet
yond light is not daylight i know it i
it is some meteor that the sun exhales
to be to thee this night a torchbearer
and light thee on the way to mantua
therefore stay yet thou needst not to be gone

romeo
let me be taen let me be put to death
i am content so thou wilt have it so
ill say yon gray is not the mornings eye
tis but the pale reflex of cynthias brow
nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
the vaulty heaven so high above our heads
i have more care to stay than will to go
come death and welcome  juliet wills it so
how ist my soul lets talkit is not day

juliet
it is it ishie hence be gone away
it is the lark that sings so out of tune
straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
some say the lark makes sweet division
this doth not so for she divideth us
some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes
o now i would they had changd voices too
since arm from arm that voice doth us affray
hunting thee hence with huntsup to the day
o now be gone more light and light it grows

juliet
yet let me weep for such a feeling loss

lady capulet
so shall you feel the loss but not the friend
which you weep for

juliet
feeling so the loss
i cannot choose but ever weep the friend

lady capulet
well girl thou weepst not so much for his death
as that the villain lives which slaughterd him

juliet
what villain madam

lady capulet
that same villain romeo

juliet
villain and he be many miles asunder
god pardon him  i do with all my heart
and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart

lady capulet
that is because the traitor murderer lives

juliet
ay madam from the reach of these my hands
would none but i might venge my cousins death

lady capulet
we will have vengeance for it fear thou not
then weep no more  ill send to one in mantua
where that same banishd runagate doth live

that he shall soon keep tybalt company
and then i hope thou wilt be satisfied

juliet
indeed i never shall be satisfied
with romeo till i behold himdead
is my poor heart so for a kinsman vexd
madam if you could find out but a man
to bear a poison i would temper it
that romeo should upon receipt thereof
soon sleep in quiet  o how my heart abhors
to hear him namdand cannot come to him
to wreak the love i bore my cousin tybalt
upon his body that hath slaughterd him

lady capulet

but now ill tell thee joyful tidings girl

juliet
and joy comes well in such a needy time
what are they i beseech your ladyship

ere he that should be husband comes to woo
i pray you tell my lord and father madam

exit

juliet
o godo nurse how shall this be prevented
my husband is on earth my faith in heaven

unless that husband send it me from heaven
by leaving earthcomfort me counsel me
alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems
upon so soft a subject as myself
what sayst thou  hast thou not a word of joy
some comfort nurse

nurse
faith here tis romeo
is banished and all the world to nothing
that he dares neer come back to challenge you
or if he do it needs must be by stealth
then since the case so stands as now it doth
i think it best you married with the county
o hes a lovely gentleman
romeos a dishclout to him an eagle madam
hath not so green so quick so fair an eye
as paris hath beshrew my very heart
i think you are happy in this second match
for it excels your first or if it did not
your first is dead or twere as good he were
as living here and you no use of him

juliet
speakest thou this from thy heart

nurse
and from my soul too
or else beshrew them both

nurse
marry i will and this is wisely done

exit

juliet
ancient damnation  o most wicked fiend
is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn
or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
which she hath praisd him with above compare
so many thousand timesgo counsellor

act iv

scene i friar lawrences cell

enter friar lawrence and paris

friar
on thursday sir the time is very short

paris
my father capulet will have it so
and i am nothing slow to slack his haste

friar
you say you do not know the ladys mind
uneven is the course i like it not

paris
immoderately she weeps for tybalts death
and therefore have i little talkd of love
for venus smiles not in a house of tears
now sir her father counts it dangerous
that she do give her sorrow so much sway
and in his wisdom hastes our marriage
to stop the inundation of her tears
which too much minded by herself alone
may be put from her by society
now do you know the reason of this haste

friar
aside i would i knew not why it should be slowd
look sir here comes the lady toward my cell

enter juliet

paris
happily met my lady and my wife

juliet
that may be sir when i may be a wife

paris
that may be must be love on thursday next

juliet
what must be shall be

friar
thats a certain text

paris
come you to make confession to this father

juliet
to answer that i should confess to you

paris
do not deny to him that you love me

juliet
i will confess to you that i love him

paris
so will ye i am sure that you love me

juliet
if i do so it will be of more price
being spoke behind your back than to your face

paris
poor soul thy face is much abusd with tears

juliet
the tears have got small victory by that
for it was bad enough before their spite

paris
thou wrongst it more than tears with that report

juliet
that is no slander sir which is a truth
and what i spake i spake it to my face

paris
thy face is mine and thou hast slanderd it

juliet
it may be so for it is not mine own
are you at leisure holy father now
or shall i come to you at evening mass

friar
my leisure serves me pensive daughter now
my lord we must entreat the time alone

paris
god shield i should disturb devotion
juliet on thursday early will i rouse you
till then adieu and keep this holy kiss

exit

juliet
o shut the door and when thou hast done so
come weep with me past hope past cure past help

friar
ah juliet i already know thy grief
it strains me past the compass of my wits
i hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it
on thursday next be married to this county

juliet
tell me not friar that thou hearst of this
unless thou tell me how i may prevent it
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help
do thou but call my resolution wise
and with this knife ill help it presently
god joind my heart and romeos thou our hands
and ere this hand by thee to romeos seald
shall be the label to another deed
or my true heart with treacherous revolt
turn to another this shall slay them both
therefore out of thy longexperiencd time
give me some present counsel or behold
twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
shall play the empire arbitrating that
which the commission of thy years and art
could to no issue of true honour bring
be not so long to speak i long to die
if what thou speakst speak not of remedy

friar
hold daughter i do spy a kind of hope
which craves as desperate an execution
as that is desperate which we would prevent
if rather than to marry county paris
thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
then is it likely thou wilt undertake
a thing like death to chide away this shame
that copst with death himself to scape from it
and if thou darst ill give thee remedy

juliet
o bid me leap rather than marry paris
from off the battlements of yonder tower
or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
where serpents are chain me with roaring bears
or shut me nightly in a charnelhouse
oercoverd quite with dead mens rattling bones
with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
or bid me go into a newmade grave
and hide me with a dead man in his shroud
things that to hear them told have made me tremble
and i will do it without fear or doubt
to live an unstaind wife to my sweet love

friar
hold then go home be merry give consent
to marry paris wednesday is tomorrow
tomorrow night look that thou lie alone
let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
take thou this vial being then in bed
and this distilled liquor drink thou off
when presently through all thy veins shall run
a cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
shall keep his native progress but surcease
no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
to paly ashes thy eyes windows fall
like death when he shuts up the day of life
each part deprivd of supple government
shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
and in this borrowd likeness of shrunk death
thou shalt continue twoandforty hours
and then awake as from a pleasant sleep
now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
thenas the manner of our country is
in thy best robes uncoverd on the bier
thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
where all the kindred of the capulets lie
in the mean time against thou shalt awake
shall romeo by my letters know our drift
and hither shall he come and he and i
will watch thy waking and that very night
shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua
and this shall free thee from this present shame
if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
abate thy valour in the acting it

juliet
give me give me  o tell not me of fear

friar
hold get you gone be strong and prosperous
in this resolve ill send a friar with speed
to mantua with my letters to thy lord

juliet
love give me strength and strength shall help afford
farewell dear father

my dismal scene i needs must act alone
come vial
what if this mixture do not work at all
shall i be married then tomorrow morning
no nothis shall forbid itlie thou there

laying down her dagger

what if it be a poison which the friar
subtly hath ministerd to have me dead
lest in this marriage he should be dishonourd
because he married me before to romeo
i fear it is and yet methinks it should not
for he hath still been tried a holy man
i will not entertain so bad a thought
how if when i am laid into the tomb
i wake before the time that romeo
come to redeem me theres a fearful point
shall i not then be stifled in the vault
to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
and there die strangled ere my romeo comes
or if i live is it not very like
the horrible conceit of death and night
together with the terror of the place
as in a vault an ancient receptacle
where for this many hundred years the bones
of all my buried ancestors are packd
where bloody tybalt yet but green in earth
lies festering in his shroud where as they say
at some hours in the night spirits resort
alack alack is it not like that i
so early wakingwhat with loathsome smells
and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth
that living mortals hearing them run mad
o if i wake shall i not be distraught
environed with all these hideous fears
and madly play with my forefathers joints
and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud
and in this rage with some great kinsmans bone
as with a club dash out my desperate brains
o look methinks i see my cousins ghost
seeking out romeo that did spit his body
upon a rapiers pointstay tybalt stay
romeo i come this do i drink to thee

and weep ye now seeing she is advancd
above the clouds as high as heaven itself
o in this love you love your child so ill
that you run mad seeing that she is well
shes not well married that lives married long
but shes best married that dies married young
dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
on this fair corse and as the custom is

and all things change them to the contrary

my dreams presage some joyful news at hand
my bosoms lord sits lightly in his throne
and all this day an unaccustomd spirit
lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
i dreamt my lady came and found me dead
strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think
and breathd such life with kisses in my lips
that i revivd and was an emperor
ah me how sweet is love itself possessd
when but loves shadows are so rich in joy

balthasar
then she is well and nothing can be ill
her body sleeps in capels monument
and her immortal part with angels lives
i saw her laid low in her kindreds vault
and presently took post to tell it you
o pardon me for bringing these ill news
since you did leave it for my office sir

thou knowst my lodging get me ink and paper
and hire posthorses i will hence tonight

your looks are pale and wild and do import
some misadventure

exit balthasar

well juliet i will lie with thee tonight
lets see for meanso mischief thou art swift
to enter in the thoughts of desperate men
i do remember an apothecary
and hereabouts he dwellswhich late i noted
in tatterd weeds with overwhelming brows
culling of simples meagre were his looks
sharp misery had worn him to the bones
and in his needy shop a tortoise hung
an alligator stuffd and other skins
of illshaped fishes and about his shelves
a beggarly account of empty boxes
green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds
remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses
were thinly scatterd to make up a show
noting this penury to myself i said
an if a man did need a poison now
whose sale is present death in mantua
here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him
o this same thought did but forerun my need
and this same needy man must sell it me
as i remember this should be the house
being holiday the beggars shop is shut
what ho apothecary

come hither mani see that thou art poor
hold there is forty ducats let me have
a dram of poison such soonspeeding gear
as will disperse itself through all the veins
that the lifeweary taker mall fall dead
and that the trunk may be dischargd of breath
as violently as hasty powder fird
doth hurry from the fatal cannons womb

apothecary
such mortal drugs i have but mantuas law
is death to any he that utters them

romeo
art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
and fearst to die famine is in thy cheeks
need and oppression starveth in thine eyes
contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back
the world is not thy friend nor the worlds law
the world affords no law to make thee rich
then be not poor but break it and take this

apothecary
my poverty but not my will consents

romeo
i pay thy poverty and not thy will

apothecary
put this in any liquid thing you will
and drink it off and if you had the strength
of twenty men it would despatch you straight

romeo
there is thy gold worse poison to mens souls
doing more murders in this loathsome world
than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
i sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
farewell buy food and get thyself in flesh
come cordial and not poison go with me
to juliets grave for there must i use thee

whateer thou hearst or seest stand all aloof
and do not interrupt me in my course
why i descend into this bed of death
is partly to behold my ladys face
but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
a precious ringa ring that i must use
in dear employment therefore hence be gone
but if thou jealous dost return to pry
in what i further shall intend to do
by heaven i will tear thee joint by joint
and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs

enter capulet lady capulet and others

capulet
what should it be that they so shriek abroad

lady capulet
the people in the street cry romeo
some juliet and some paris and all run
with open outcry toward our monument

prince
what fear is this which startles in our ears

1 watch
sovereign here lies the county paris slain
and romeo dead and juliet dead before
warm and new killd

prince
search seek and know how this foul murder comes

1 watch
here is a friar and slaughterd romeos man
with instruments upon them fit to open
these dead mens tombs

capulet
o heaveno wife look how our daughter bleeds
this dagger hath mistaenfor lo his house
is empty on the back of montague
and it missheathed in my daughters bosom

lady capulet
o me this sight of death is as a bell
that warns my old age to a sepulchre

enter montague and others

prince
come montague for thou art early up
to see thy son and heir more early down

montague
alas my liege my wife is dead tonight
grief of my sons exile hath stoppd her breath
what further woe conspires against mine age

prince
look and thou shalt see

montague
o thou untaught what manners is in this
to press before thy father to a grave

prince
seal up the mouth of outrage for a while
till we can clear these ambiguities
and know their spring their head their true descent
and then will i be general of your woes
and lead you even to death meantime forbear
and let mischance be slave to patience
bring forth the parties of suspicion

friar
i am the greatest able to do least
yet most suspected as the time and place
doth make against me of this direful murder
and here i stand both to impeach and purge
myself condemned and myself excusd

prince
then say at once what thou dost know in this

friar
i will be brief for my short date of breath
is not so long as is a tedious tale
romeo there dead was husband to that juliet
and she there dead that romeos faithful wife
i married them and their stoln marriage day
was tybalts doomsday whose untimely death
banishd the newmade bridegroom from this city
for whom and not for tybalt juliet pind
you to remove that siege of grief from her
betrothd and would have married her perforce
to county paristhen comes she to me
and with wild looks bid me devise some means
to rid her from this second marriage
or in my cell there would she kill herself
then gave i her so tutored by my art
a sleeping potion which so took effect
as i intended for it wrought on her
the form of death meantime i writ to romeo
that he should hither come as this dire night
to help to take her from her borrowd grave
being the time the potions force should cease
but he which bore my letter friar john
was stayd by accident and yesternight
returnd my letter back then all alone
at the prefixed hour of her waking
came i to take her from her kindreds vault
meaning to keep her closely at my cell
till i conveniently could send to romeo
but when i camesome minute ere the time
of her awakinghere untimely lay
the noble paris and true romeo dead
she wakes and i entreated her come forth
and bear this work of heaven with patience
but then a noise did scare me from the tomb
and she too desperate would not go with me
but as it seems did violence on herself
all this i know and to the marriage
her nurse is privy and if ought in this
miscarried by my fault let my old life
be sacrificd some hour before his time
unto the rigour of severest law

prince
we still have known thee for a holy man
wheres romeos man what can he say in this

balthasar
i brought my master news of juliets death
and then in post he came from mantua
to this same place to this same monument
this letter he early bid me give his father
and threatend me with death going in the vault
if i departed not and left him there

prince
give me the letteri will look on it
where is the countys page that raisd the watch
sirrah what made your master in this place

boy
he came with flowers to strew his ladys grave
and bid me stand aloof and so i did
anon comes one with light to ope the tomb
and byandby my master drew on him
and then i ran away to call the watch

prince
this letter doth make good the friars words
their course of love the tidings of her death
and here he writes that he did buy a poison
of a poor pothecary and therewithal
came to this vault to die and lie with juliet
where be these enemiescapuletmontague
see what a scourge is laid upon your hate
that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
and i for winking at your discords too
have lost a brace of kinsmenall are punishd

capulet
o brother montague give me thy hand
this is my daughters jointure for no more
can i demand

montague
but i can give thee more
for i will raise her statue in pure gold
that while verona by that name is known
there shall no figure at such rate be set
as that of true and faithful juliet

capulet
as rich shall romeos by his ladys lie
poor sacrifices of our enmity

prince
a glooming peace this morning with it brings
  the sun for sorrow will not show his head
go hence to have more talk of these sad things
  some shall be pardond and some punished
for never was a story of more woe
than this of juliet and her romeo

project gutenberg etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the public domain in the united states unless a
copyright notice is included  therefore we usually do not keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


we are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

please note  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
the official release date of all project gutenberg etexts is at
midnight central time of the last day of the stated month  a
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so  to be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month  since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a

we produce about two million dollars for each hour we work  the
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc  this
projected audience is one hundred million readers  if our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
if these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion etexts given away this year

the goal of project gutenberg is to give away one trillion etext
files by december 31 2001  10000 x 100000000  1 trillion
this is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

at our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from michael harts salary at carnegiemellon university and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want project gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

project gutenbergs etext of shakespeares the life of henry the
fift



executive directors notes

in addition to the notes below and so you will not think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected here are the first few lines of hamlet as they
are presented herein

  barnardo whos there
  fran nay answer me stand  vnfold
your selfe

   bar long liue the king



as i understand it the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a cliche  this is the
original meaning of the term cliche  and thus being unwilling
to unpack the cliches and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd  such as the exchanges of u for v v for u
above  and you may wonder why they did it this way presuming
shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner   

the answer is that they may have packed liue into a cliche at a
time when they were out of vs  possibly having used vv in
place of some ws etc  this was a common practice of the day
as print was still quite expensive and they didnt want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to

you will find a lot of these kinds of errors in this text as i
have mentioned in other times and places many scholars have an
extreme attachment to these errors and many have accorded them a
very high place in the canon of shakespeare  my father read an
assortment of these made available to him by cambridge university
in england for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose  to the best of my knowledge he read all those available
  in great detail  and determined from the various changes
that shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for even though he was infamous
for signing his name with several different spellings

so please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file  you may see errors
that are not errors   

so  with this caveat  we have not changed the canon errors
here is the project gutenberg etext of shakespeares the life of
henry the fift

scanners notes what this is and isnt  this was taken from
a copy of shakespeares first folio and it is as close as i can
come in ascii to the printed text

the elongated ss have been changed to small ss and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae  i have left the spelling
punctuation capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text  i have corrected some spelling mistakes i have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
geneva bible and shakespeares first folio and have unified
spellings according to this template typos and expanded
abbreviations as i have come across them  everything within
brackets  is what i have added  so if you dont like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer shakespeare

another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio  so there may
be differences other than what i have mentioned above between
this and other first folio editions  this is due to the printers
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run  the proof run wasnt thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies  this is just the way it is
the text i have used was a composite of more than 30 different
first folio editions best pages

if you find any scanning errors out and out typos punctuation
errors or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors  i wish to make this the best
etext possible  my email address for right now are haraddaaolcom
and davidrinconnectcom  i hope that you enjoy this

o for a muse of fire that would ascend

a kingdome for a stage princes to act

crouch for employment but pardon gentles all
the flat vnraysed spirits that hath dard
on this vnworthy scaffold to bring forth
so great an obiect can this cockpit hold
the vastie fields of france or may we cramme
within this woodden o the very caskes
that did affright the ayre at agincourt
o pardon since a crooked figure may
attest in little place a million

on your imaginarie forces worke
suppose within the girdle of these walls
are now confind two mightie monarchies
whose high vpreared and abutting fronts
the perillous narrow ocean parts asunder
peece out our imperfections with your thoughts
into a thousand parts diuide one man
and make imaginarie puissance
thinke when we talke of horses that you see them
printing their prowd hoofes ith receiuing earth

enter the two bishops of canterbury and ely

  bishcant my lord ile tell you that selfe bill is vrgd
which in th eleuenth yere of y last kings reign
was like and had indeed against vs past
but that the scambling and vnquiet time
did push it out of farther question

   bishely but how my lord shall we resist it now
  bishcant it must be thought on if it passe against vs
we loose the better halfe of our possession
for all the temporall lands which men deuout
by testament haue giuen to the church
would they strip from vs being valud thus
as much as would maintaine to the kings honor
full fifteene earles and fifteene hundred knights
six thousand and two hundred good esquires
and to reliefe of lazars and weake age
of indigent faint soules past corporall toyle
a hundred almeshouses right well supplyd
and to the coffers of the king beside
a thousand pounds by th yeere thus runs the bill

   bishely this would drinke deepe

   bishcant twould drinke the cup and all

   bishely but what preuention
  bishcant the king is full of grace and faire regard

   bishely and a true louer of the holy church

   bishcant the courses of his youth promisd it not
the breath no sooner left his fathers body
but that his wildnesse mortifyd in him
seemd to dye too yea at that very moment
consideration like an angell came
and whipt th offending adam out of him
leauing his body as a paradise
t inuelop and containe celestiall spirits
neuer was such a sodaine scholler made
neuer came reformation in a flood
with such a heady currance scowring faults
nor neuer hidraheaded wilfulnesse
so soone did loose his seat and all at once
as in this king

   bishely we are blessed in the change

   bishcant heare him but reason in diuinitie
and alladmiring with an inward wish
you would desire the king were made a prelate
heare him debate of commonwealth affaires
you would say it hath been all in all his study
list his discourse of warre and you shall heare
a fearefull battaile rendred you in musique
turne him to any cause of pollicy
the gordian knot of it he will vnloose
familiar as his garter that when he speakes
the ayre a charterd libertine is still
and the mute wonder lurketh in mens eares
to steale his sweet and honyed sentences
so that the art and practique part of life
must be the mistresse to this theorique
which is a wonder how his grace should gleane it
since his addiction was to courses vaine
his companies vnletterd rude and shallow
his houres filld vp with ryots banquets sports
and neuer noted in him any studie
any retyrement any sequestration
from open haunts and popularitie

   bely the strawberry growes vnderneath the nettle
and holesome berryes thriue and ripen best
neighbourd by fruit of baser qualitie
and so the prince obscurd his contemplation
vnder the veyle of wildnesse which no doubt
grew like the summer grasse fastest by night
vnseene yet cressiue in his facultie

   bcant it must be so for miracles are ceast
and therefore we must needes admit the meanes
how things are perfected

   bely but my good lord
how now for mittigation of this bill
vrgd by the commons doth his maiestie
incline to it or no
  bcant he seemes indifferent
or rather swaying more vpon our part
then cherishing th exhibiters against vs
for i haue made an offer to his maiestie
vpon our spirituall conuocation
and in regard of causes now in hand
which i haue opend to his grace at large
as touching france to giue a greater summe
then euer at one time the clergie yet
did to his predecessors part withall

   bely how did this offer seeme receiud my lord
  bcant with good acceptance of his maiestie
saue that there was not time enough to heare
as i perceiud his grace would faine haue done
the seueralls and vnhidden passages
of his true titles to some certaine dukedomes
and generally to the crowne and seat of france
deriud from edward his great grandfather

   bely what was th impediment that broke this off
  bcant the french embassador vpon that instant
craud audience and the howre i thinke is come
to giue him hearing is it foure a clock
  bely it is

   bcant then goe we in to know his embassie
which i could with a ready guesse declare
before the frenchman speake a word of it

   bely ile wait vpon you and i long to heare it

that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading

with opening titles miscreate whose right
sutes not in natiue colours with the truth
for god doth know how many now in health
shall drop their blood in approbation
of what your reuerence shall incite vs to
therefore take heed how you impawne our person
how you awake our sleeping sword of warre
we charge you in the name of god take heed
for neuer two such kingdomes did contend
without much fall of blood whose guiltlesse drops
are euery one a woe a sore complaint
gainst him whose wrongs giues edge vnto the swords
that makes such waste in briefe mortalitie
vnder this coniuration speake my lord
for we will heare note and beleeue in heart
that what you speake is in your conscience washt
as pure as sinne with baptisme

   bcan then heare me gracious soueraign  you peers
that owe your selues your liues and seruices
to this imperiall throne there is no barre
to make against your highnesse clayme to france
but this which they produce from pharamond
in terram salicam mulieres ne succedant
no woman shall succeed in salike land
which salike land the french vniustly gloze
to be the realme of france and pharamond
the founder of this law and female barre
yet their owne authors faithfully affirme
that the land salike is in germanie
betweene the flouds of sala and of elue
where charles the great hauing subdud the saxons
there left behind and settled certaine french
who holding in disdaine the german women
for some dishonest manners of their life
establisht then this law to wit no female
should be inheritrix in salike land
which salike as i said twixt elue and sala
is at this day in germanie calld meisen
then doth it well appeare the salike law
was not deuised for the realme of france
nor did the french possesse the salike land
vntill foure hundred one and twentie yeeres
after defunction of king pharamond
idly supposd the founder of this law
who died within the yeere of our redemption
foure hundred twentie six and charles the great
subdud the saxons and did seat the french
beyond the riuer sala in the yeere
eight hundred fiue besides their writers say
king pepin which deposed childerike
did as heire generall being descended
of blithild which was daughter to king clothair
make clayme and title to the crowne of france
hugh capet also who vsurpt the crowne
of charles the duke of loraine sole heire male
of the true line and stock of charles the great
to find his title with some shewes of truth
though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught
conueyd himselfe as th heire to th lady lingare
daughter to charlemaine who was the sonne
to lewes the emperour and lewes the sonne
of charles the great also king lewes the tenth
who was sole heire to the vsurper capet
could not keepe quiet in his conscience
wearing the crowne of france till satisfied
that faire queene isabel his grandmother
was lineall of the lady ermengare
daughter to charles the foresaid duke of loraine
by the which marriage the lyne of charles the great
was revnited to the crowne of france
so that as cleare as is the summers sunne
king pepins title and hugh capets clayme
king lewes his satisfaction all appeare
to hold in right and title of the female
so doe the kings of france vnto this day
howbeit they would hold vp this salique law
to barre your highnesse clayming from the female
and rather chuse to hide them in a net
then amply to imbarre their crooked titles
vsurpt from you and your progenitors

   king may i with right and conscience make this claim
  bishcant the sinne vpon my head dread soueraigne
for in the booke of numbers is it writ
when the man dyes let the inheritance
descend vnto the daughter gracious lord
stand for your owne vnwind your bloody flagge
looke back into your mightie ancestors
goe my dread lord to your great grandsires tombe
from whom you clayme inuoke his warlike spirit
and your great vnckles edward the black prince
who on the french ground playd a tragedie
making defeat on the full power of france
whiles his most mightie father on a hill
stood smiling to behold his lyons whelpe
forrage in blood of french nobilitie
o noble english that could entertaine
with halfe their forces the full pride of france
and let another halfe stand laughing by
all out of worke and cold for action

   bish awake remembrance of these valiant dead
and with your puissant arme renew their feats
you are their heire you sit vpon their throne
the blood and courage that renowned them
runs in your veines and my thricepuissant liege
is in the very maymorne of his youth
ripe for exploits and mightie enterprises

   exe your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
doe all expect that you should rowse your selfe
as did the former lyons of your blood

   west they know your grace hath cause and means and might
so hath your highnesse neuer king of england
had nobles richer and more loyall subiects
whose hearts haue left their bodyes here in england
and lye pauilliond in the fields of france

   bishcan o let their bodyes follow my deare liege
with bloods and sword and fire to win your right
in ayde whereof we of the spiritualtie
will rayse your highnesse such a mightie summe
as neuer did the clergie at one time
bring in to any of your ancestors

   king we must not onely arme t inuade the french
but lay downe our proportions to defend
against the scot who will make roade vpon vs
with all aduantages

   bishcan they of those marches gracious soueraign
shall be a wall sufficient to defend
our inland from the pilfering borderers

   king we do not meane the coursing snatchers onely
but feare the maine intendment of the scot
who hath been still a giddy neighbour to vs
for you shall reade that my great grandfather
neuer went with his forces into france
but that the scot on his vnfurnisht kingdome
came pouring like the tyde into a breach
with ample and brim fulnesse of his force
galling the gleaned land with hot assayes
girding with grieuous siege castles and townes
that england being emptie of defence
hath shooke and trembled at th ill neighbourhood

   bcan she hath bin then more feard then harmd my liege
for heare her but exampld by her selfe
when all her cheualrie hath been in france
and shee a mourning widdow of her nobles
shee hath her selfe not onely well defended
but taken and impounded as a stray
the king of scots whom shee did send to france
to fill king edwards fame with prisoner kings
and make their chronicle as rich with prayse
as is the owse and bottome of the sea
with sunken wrack and sumlesse treasuries

   bishely but theres a saying very old and true
if that you will france win then with scotland first begin
for once the eagle england being in prey
to her vnguarded nest the weazell scot
comes sneaking and so sucks her princely egges
playing the mouse in absence of the cat
to tame and hauocke more then she can eate

   exet it followes then the cat must stay at home
yet that is but a crushd necessity
since we haue lockes to safegard necessaries
and pretty traps to catch the petty theeues
while that the armed hand doth fight abroad
th aduised head defends it selfe at home
for gouernment though high and low and lower
put into parts doth keepe in one consent
congreeing in a full and natural close
like musicke

   cant therefore doth heauen diuide
the state of man in diuers functions
setting endeuour in continual motion
to which is fixed as an ayme or butt
obedience for so worke the hony bees
creatures that by a rule in nature teach
the act of order to a peopled kingdome
they haue a king and officers of sorts
where some like magistrates correct at home
others like merchants venter trade abroad
others like souldiers armed in their stings
make boote vpon the summers veluet buddes
which pillage they with merry march bring home
to the tentroyal of their emperor
who busied in his maiesties surueyes
the singing masons building roofes of gold
the ciuil citizens kneading vp the hony
the poore mechanicke porters crowding in
their heauy burthens at his narrow gate
the sadeyd iustice with his surly humme
deliuering ore to executors pale
the lazie yawning drone i this inferre
that many things hauing full reference
to one consent may worke contrariously
as many arrowes loosed seuerall wayes
come to one marke as many wayes meet in one towne
as many fresh streames meet in one salt sea
as many lynes close in the dials center
so may a thousand actions once a foote
and in one purpose and be all well borne
without defeat therefore to france my liege
diuide your happy england into foure
whereof take you one quarter into france
and you withall shall make all gallia shake
if we with thrice such powers left at home
cannot defend our owne doores from the dogge
let vs be worried and our nation lose
the name of hardinesse and policie

   king call in the messengers sent from the dolphin
now are we well resolud and by gods helpe
and yours the noble sinewes of our power
france being ours weel bend it to our awe
or breake it all to peeces or there weel sit
ruling in large and ample emperie
ore france and all her almost kingly dukedomes
or lay these bones in an vnworthy vrne
tomblesse with no remembrance ouer them
either our history shall with full mouth
speake freely of our acts or else our graue
like turkish mute shall haue a tonguelesse mouth
not worshipt with a waxen epitaph
enter ambassadors of france

now are we well prepard to know the pleasure
of our faire cosin dolphin for we heare
your greeting is from him not from the king

   amb mayt please your maiestie to giue vs leaue
freely to render what we haue in charge
or shall we sparingly shew you farre off
the dolphins meaning and our embassie

   king we are no tyrant but a christian king
vnto whose grace our passion is as subiect
as is our wretches fettred in our prisons
therefore with franke and with vncurbed plainnesse
tell vs the dolphins minde

   amb thus than in few
your highnesse lately sending into france
did claime some certaine dukedomes in the right
of your great predecessor king edward the third
in answer of which claime the prince our master
sayes that you sauour too much of your youth
and bids you be aduisd theres nought in france
that can be with a nimble galliard wonne
you cannot reuell into dukedomes there
he therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
this tun of treasure and in lieu of this
desires you let the dukedomes that you claime
heare no more of you this the dolphin speakes

   king what treasure vncle
  exe tennis balles my liege

   kin we are glad the dolphin is so pleasant with vs
his present and your paines we thanke you for
when we haue matcht our rackets to these balles
we will in france by gods grace play a set
shall strike his fathers crowne into the hazard
tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
that all the courts of france will be disturbd
with chaces and we vnderstand him well
how he comes ore vs with our wilder dayes
not measuring what vse we made of them
we neuer valewd this poore seate of england
and therefore liuing hence did giue our selfe
to barbarous license as tis euer common
that men are merriest when they are from home
but tell the dolphin i will keepe my state
be like a king and shew my sayle of greatnesse
when i do rowse me in my throne of france
for that i haue layd by my maiestie
and plodded like a man for working dayes
but i will rise there with so full a glorie
that i will dazle all the eyes of france
yea strike the dolphin blinde to looke on vs
and tell the pleasant prince this mocke of his
hath turnd his balles to gunstones and his soule
shall stand sore charged for the wastefull vengeance
that shall flye with them for many a thousand widows
shall this his mocke mocke out of their deer husbands
mocke mothers from their sonnes mock castles downe
and some are yet vngotten and vnborne
that shal haue cause to curse the dolphins scorne
but this lyes all within the wil of god
to whom i do appeale and in whose name
tel you the dolphin i am comming on
to venge me as i may and to put forth
my rightfull hand in a welhallowd cause
so get you hence in peace and tell the dolphin
his iest will sauour but of shallow wit
when thousands weepe more then did laugh at it
conuey them with safe conduct fare you well

exeunt ambassadors

  exe this was a merry message

   king we hope to make the sender blush at it
therefore my lords omit no happy howre
that may giue furthrance to our expedition
for we haue now no thought in vs but france
saue those to god that runne before our businesse
therefore let our proportions for these warres
be soone collected and all things thought vpon
that may with reasonable swiftnesse adde
more feathers to our wings for god before
weele chide this dolphin at his fathers doore
therefore let euery man now taske his thought
that this faire action may on foot be brought

exeunt

flourish enter chorus

now all the youth of england are on fire
and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lyes
now thriue the armorers and honors thought
reignes solely in the breast of euery man
they sell the pasture now to buy the horse
following the mirror of all christian kings
with winged heeles as english mercuries
for now sits expectation in the ayre
and hides a sword from hilts vnto the point
with crownes imperiall crownes and coronets
promisd to harry and his followers
the french aduisd by good intelligence
of this most dreadfull preparation
shake in their feare and with pale pollicy
seeke to diuert the english purposes
o england modell to thy inward greatnesse
like little body with a mightie heart
what mightst thou do that honour would thee do
were all thy children kinde and naturall
but see thy fault france hath in thee found out
a nest of hollow bosomes which he filles
with treacherous crownes and three corrupted men
one richard earle of cambridge and the second
henry lord scroope of masham and the third
sir thomas grey knight of northumberland
haue for the gilt of france o guilt indeed
confirmd conspiracy with fearefull france
and by their hands this grace of kings must dye
if hell and treason hold their promises
ere he take ship for france and in southampton
linger your patience on and weel digest
th abuse of distance force a play
the summe is payde the traitors are agreed
the king is set from london and the scene
is now transported gentles to southampton
there is the playhouse now there must you sit
and thence to france shall we conuey you safe
and bring you backe charming the narrow seas
to giue you gentle passe for if we may
weel not offend one stomacke with our play
but till the king come forth and not till then
vnto southampton do we shift our scene

   king the mercy that was quicke in vs but late
by your owne counsaile is supprest and killd
you must not dare for shame to talke of mercy
for your owne reasons turne into your bosomes
as dogs vpon their maisters worrying you
see you my princes and my noble peeres
these english monsters my lord of cambridge heere
you know how apt our loue was to accord
to furnish with all appertinents
belonging to his honour and this man
hath for a few light crownes lightly conspird
and sworne vnto the practises of france
to kill vs heere in hampton to the which
this knight no lesse for bounty bound to vs
then cambridge is hath likewise sworne but o
what shall i say to thee lord scroope thou cruell
ingratefull sauage and inhumane creature
thou that didst beare the key of all my counsailes
that knewst the very bottome of my soule
that almost mightst haue coynd me into golde
wouldst thou haue practisd on me for thy vse
may it be possible that forraigne hyer
could out of thee extract one sparke of euill
that might annoy my finger tis so strange
that though the truth of it stands off as grosse
as black and white my eye will scarsely see it
treason and murther euer kept together
as two yoake diuels sworne to eythers purpose
working so grossely in an naturall cause
that admiration did not hoope at them
but thou gainst all proportion didst bring in
wonder to waite on treason and on murther
and whatsoeuer cunning fiend it was
that wrought vpon thee so preposterously
hath got the voyce in hell for excellence
and other diuels that suggest by treasons
do botch and bungle vp damnation
with patches colours and with formes being fetcht
from glistring semblances of piety
but he that temperd thee bad thee stand vp
gaue thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason
vnlesse to dub thee with the name of traitor
if that same daemon that hath gulld thee thus
should with his lyongate walke the whole world
he might returne to vastie tartar backe
and tell the legions i can neuer win
a soule so easie as that englishmans
oh how hast thou with iealousie infected
the sweetnesse of affiance shew men dutifull
why so didst thou seeme they graue and learned
why so didst thou come they of noble family
why so didst thou seeme they religious
why so didst thou or are they spare in diet
free from grosse passion or of mirth or anger
constant in spirit not sweruing with the blood
garnishd and deckd in modest complement
not working with the eye without the eare
and but in purged iudgement trusting neither
such and so finely boulted didst thou seeme
and thus thy fall hath left a kinde of blot
to make thee full fraught man and best indued
with some suspition i will weepe for thee
for this reuolt of thine me thinkes is like
another fall of man their faults are open
arrest them to the answer of the law
and god acquit them of their practises

   exe i arrest thee of high treason by the name of
richard earle of cambridge
i arrest thee of high treason by the name of thomas
lord scroope of marsham
i arrest thee of high treason by the name of thomas
grey knight of northumberland

   scro our purposes god iustly hath discouerd
and i repent my fault more then my death
which i beseech your highnesse to forgiue
although my body pay the price of it

   cam for me the gold of france did not seduce
although i did admit it as a motiue
the sooner to effect what i intended
but god be thanked for preuention
which in sufferance heartily will reioyce
beseeching god and you to pardon mee

   gray neuer did faithfull subiect more reioyce
at the discouery of most dangerous treason
then i do at this houre ioy ore my selfe
preuented from a damned enterprize
my fault but not my body pardon soueraigne

   king god quit you in his mercy hear your sentence
you haue conspird against our royall person

and let vs doe it with no shew of feare
no with no more then if we heard that england
were busied with a whitson morrisdance

you are too much mistaken in this king
question your grace the late embassadors
with what great state he heard their embassie
how well supplyd with noble councellors
how modest in exception and withall
how terrible in constant resolution
and you shall find his vanities forespent
were but the outside of the roman brutus
couering discretion with a coat of folly
as gardeners doe with ordure hide those roots
that shall first spring and be most delicate

   dolphin well tis not so my lord high constable

in cases of defence tis best to weigh

when cressy battell fatally was strucke
and all our princes captiud by the hand
of that black name edward black prince of wales
whiles that his mountaine sire on mountaine standing

saw his heroicall seed and smild to see him
mangle the worke of nature and deface

your crowne and kingdome indirectly held
from him the natiue and true challenger

and my heart and my dutie and my liue and my liuing
and my vttermost power he is not god be praysed and
blessed any hurt in the world but keepes the bridge
most valiantly with excellent discipline there is an aunchient
lieutenant there at the pridge i thinke in my very
conscience hee is as valiant a man as marke anthony and
hee is a man of no estimation in the world but i did see
him doe as gallant seruice

   pist bardolph a souldier firme and sound of heart
and of buxome valour hath by cruell fate and giddie
fortunes furious fickle wheele that goddesse blind that
stands vpon the rolling restlesse stone

   flu by your patience aunchient pistoll fortune is
painted blinde with a muffler afore his eyes to signifie
to you that fortune is blinde and shee is painted also
with a wheele to signifie to you which is the morall of
it that shee is turning and inconstant and mutabilitie
and variation and her foot looke you is fixed vpon a
sphericall stone which rowles and rowles and rowles
in good truth the poet makes a most excellent description
of it fortune is an excellent morall

   pist fortune is bardolphs foe and frownes on him
for he hath stolne a pax and hanged must a be a damned
death let gallowes gape for dogge let man goe free
and let not hempe his windpipe suffocate but exeter
hath giuen the doome of death for pax of little price

pennycord and vile reproach speake captaine for
his life and i will thee requite

well what he has spoke to me that is well i warrant you
when time is serue

   gower why tis a gull a foole a rogue that now and
then goes to the warres to grace himselfe at his returne
into london vnder the forme of a souldier and such
fellowes are perfit in the great commanders names and
they will learne you by rote where seruices were done
at such and such a sconce at such a breach at such a conuoy
who came off brauely who was shot who disgracd
what termes the enemy stood on and this they
conne perfitly in the phrase of warre which they tricke
vp with newtuned oathes and what a beard of the generalls
cut and a horride sute of the campe will doe among
foming bottles and alewasht wits is wonderfull
to be thought on but you must learne to know such
slanders of the age or else you may be maruellously mistooke

   flu i tell you what captaine gower i doe perceiue
hee is not the man that hee would gladly make shew to

exeter is master of the pridge i can tell your maiestie

   king what men haue you lost fluellen
  flu the perdition of th athuersarie hath beene very
great reasonnable great marry for my part i thinke the

for robbing a church one bardolph if your maiestie

and knobs and flames a fire and his lippes blowes at his
nose and it is like a coale of fire sometimes plew and
sometimes red but his nose is executed and his fires
out

   king wee would haue all such offendors so cut off
and we giue expresse charge that in our marches through
the countrey there be nothing compelld from the villages
nothing taken but payd for none of the french

and admire our sufferance bid him therefore consider
of his ransome which must proportion the losses we
haue borne the subiects we haue lost the disgrace we
haue digested which in weight to reanswer his pettinesse
would bow vnder for our losses his exchequer is
too poore for th effusion of our bloud the muster of his
kingdome too faint a number and for our disgrace his
owne person kneeling at our feet but a weake and worthlesse
satisfaction to this adde defiance and tell him for
conclusion he hath betrayed his followers whose condemnation

vnto an enemie of craft and vantage
my people are with sicknesse much enfeebled
my numbers lessend and those few i haue
almost no better then so many french
who when they were in health i tell thee herald

fills the wide vessell of the vniuerse
from camp to camp through the foule womb of night
the humme of eyther army stilly sounds
that the fixt centinels almost receiue
the secret whispers of each others watch
fire answers fire and through their paly flames
each battaile sees the others vmberd face
steed threatens steed in high and boastfull neighs
piercing the nights dull eare and from the tents
the armourers accomplishing the knights
with busie hammers closing riuets vp
giue dreadfull note of preparation
the countrey cocks doe crow the clocks doe towle
and the third howre of drowsie morning namd
prowd of their numbers and secure in soule
the confident and ouerlustie french
doe the lowrated english play at dice
and chide the creepletardygated night

so tediously away the poore condemned english
like sacrifices by their watchfull fires

the mornings danger and their gesture sad
inuesting lankeleane cheekes and warreworne coats
presented them vnto the gazing moone
so many horride ghosts o now who will behold
the royall captaine of this ruind band
walking from watch to watch from tent to tent
let him cry prayse and glory on his head
for forth he goes and visits all his hoast
bids them good morrow with a modest smyle
and calls them brothers friends and countreymen
vpon his royall face there is no note
how dread an army hath enrounded him
nor doth he dedicate one iot of colour
vnto the wearie and allwatched night
but freshly lookes and ouerbeares attaint
with chearefull semblance and sweet maiestie
that euery wretch pining and pale before
beholding him plucks comfort from his lookes
a largesse vniuersall like the sunne
his liberall eye doth giue to euery one
thawing cold feare that meane and gentle all

coxcombe is it meet thinke you that wee should

there is much care and valour in this welchman
enter three souldiers iohn bates alexander court and michael
williams


  court brother iohn bates is not that the morning
which breakes yonder
  bates i thinke it be but wee haue no great cause to
desire the approach of day

   williams wee see yonder the beginning of the day
but i thinke wee shall neuer see the end of it who goes
there
  king a friend

   williams vnder what captaine serue you
  king vnder sir iohn erpingham

   williams a good old commander and a most kinde
gentleman i pray you what thinkes he of our estate
  king euen as men wrackt vpon a sand that looke to
be washt off the next tyde

   bates he hath not told his thought to the king
  king no nor it is not meet he should for though i
speake it to you i thinke the king is but a man as i am
the violet smells to him as it doth to me the element
shewes to him as it doth to me all his sences haue but
humane conditions his ceremonies layd by in his nakednesse
he appeares but a man and though his affections
are higher mounted then ours yet when they stoupe
they stoupe with the like wing therefore when he sees
reason of feares as we doe his feares out of doubt be of
the same rellish as ours are yet in reason no man should
possesse him with any appearance of feare least hee by
shewing it should dishearten his army

   bates he may shew what outward courage he will
but i beleeue as cold a night as tis hee could wish himselfe
in thames vp to the neck and so i would he were
and i by him at all aduentures so we were quit here

   king by my troth i will speake my conscience of the
king i thinke hee would not wish himselfe any where
but where hee is

   bates then i would he were here alone so should he be
sure to be ransomed and a many poore mens liues saued

   king i dare say you loue him not so ill to wish him
here alone howsoeuer you speake this to feele other
mens minds me thinks i could not dye any where so contented
as in the kings company his cause being iust and
his quarrell honorable

   williams thats more then we know

   bates i or more then wee should seeke after for wee
know enough if wee know wee are the kings subiects
if his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes
the cryme of it out of vs

   williams but if the cause be not good the king himselfe
hath a heauie reckoning to make when all those
legges and armes and heads chopt off in a battaile
shall ioyne together at the latter day and cry all wee dyed
at such a place some swearing some crying for a surgean
some vpon their wiues left poore behind them
some vpon the debts they owe some vpon their children
rawly left i am afeard there are few dye well that dye
in a battaile for how can they charitably dispose of any
thing when blood is their argument now if these men
doe not dye well it will be a black matter for the king
that led them to it who to disobey were against all proportion
of subiection

   king so if a sonne that is by his father sent about
merchandize doe sinfully miscarry vpon the sea the imputation
of his wickednesse by your rule should be imposed
vpon his father that sent him or if a seruant vnder
his masters command transporting a summe of money
be assayled by robbers and dye in many irreconcild
iniquities you may call the businesse of the master the
author of the seruants damnation but this is not so
the king is not bound to answer the particular endings
of his souldiers the father of his sonne nor the master
of his seruant for they purpose not their death when
they purpose their seruices besides there is no king be
his cause neuer so spotlesse if it come to the arbitrement
of swords can trye it out with all vnspotted souldiers
some peraduenture haue on them the guilt of
premeditated and contriued murther some of beguiling
virgins with the broken seales of periurie some
making the warres their bulwarke that haue before gored
the gentle bosome of peace with pillage and robberie
now if these men haue defeated the law and outrunne
natiue punishment though they can outstrip
men they haue no wings to flye from god warre is
his beadle warre is his vengeance so that here men
are punisht for before breach of the kings lawes in
now the kings quarrell where they feared the death
they haue borne life away and where they would bee
safe they perish then if they dye vnprouided no more
is the king guiltie of their damnation then hee was before
guiltie of those impieties for the which they are
now visited euery subiects dutie is the kings but
euery subiects soule is his owne therefore should
euery souldier in the warres doe as euery sicke man in
his bed wash euery moth out of his conscience and
dying so death is to him aduantage or not dying
the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was
gayned and in him that escapes it were not sinne to
thinke that making god so free an offer he let him outliue
that day to see his greatnesse and to teach others
how they should prepare

   will tis certaine euery man that dyes ill the ill vpon
his owne head the king is not to answer it

   bates i doe not desire hee should answer for me and
yet i determine to fight lustily for him

   king i my selfe heard the king say he would not be
ransomd

   will i hee said so to make vs fight chearefully but
when our throats are cut hee may be ransomd and wee
nere the wiser

   king if i liue to see it i will neuer trust his word after

   will you pay him then thats a perillous shot out
of an elder gunne that a poore and a priuate displeasure
can doe against a monarch you may as well goe about
to turne the sunne to yce with fanning in his face with a
peacocks feather youle neuer trust his word after
come tis a foolish saying

   king your reproofe is something too round i should
be angry with you if the time were conuenient

   will let it bee a quarrell betweene vs if you
liue

   king i embrace it

   will how shall i know thee againe
  king giue me any gage of thine and i will weare it
in my bonnet then if euer thou darst acknowledge it
i will make it my quarrell

   will heeres my gloue giue mee another of
thine

   king there

   will this will i also weare in my cap if euer thou
come to me and say after to morrow this is my gloue
by this hand i will take thee a box on the eare

   king if euer i liue to see it i will challenge it

   will thou darst as well be hangd

kings companie

strength if i could winne a lady at leapefrogge or by
vawting into my saddle with my armour on my backe
vnder the correction of bragging be it spoken i should
quickly leape into a wife or if i might buffet for my
loue or bound my horse for her fauours i could lay on

for thy loue by the lord no yet i loue thee too and
while thou liust deare kate take a fellow of plaine and
vncoyned constancie for he perforce must do thee right
because he hath not the gift to wooe in other places for
these fellowes of infinit tongue that can ryme themselues
into ladyes fauours they doe alwayes reason themselues
out againe what a speaker is but a prater a ryme is
but a ballad a good legge will fall a strait backe will
stoope a blacke beard will turne white a curld pate will
grow bald a faire face will wither a full eye will wax
hollow but a good heart kate is the sunne and the
moone or rather the sunne and not the moone for it
shines bright and neuer changes but keepes his course
truly if thou would haue such a one take me and
take me take a souldier take a souldier take a king

gentle princesse because i loue thee cruelly if euer thou

this file should be named 2267txt or 2267zip


project gutenberg etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the public domain in the united states unless a
copyright notice is included  therefore we usually do not keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


we are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

please note  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
the official release date of all project gutenberg etexts is at
midnight central time of the last day of the stated month  a
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so  to be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month  since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


information about project gutenberg one page

we produce about two million dollars for each hour we work  the
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc  this
projected audience is one hundred million readers  if our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
if these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion etexts given away this year

the goal of project gutenberg is to give away one trillion etext
files by december 31 2001  10000 x 100000000  1 trillion
this is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

at our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from michael harts salary at carnegiemellon university and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want project gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

executive directors notes

in addition to the notes below and so you will not think all
the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
been corrected here are the first few lines of hamlet as they
are presented herein

  barnardo whos there
  fran nay answer me stand  vnfold
your selfe

   bar long liue the king



as i understand it the printers often ran out of certain words
or letters they had often packed into a cliche  this is the
original meaning of the term cliche  and thus being unwilling
to unpack the cliches and thus you will see some substitutions
that look very odd  such as the exchanges of u for v v for u
above  and you may wonder why they did it this way presuming
shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner   

the answer is that they may have packed liue into a cliche at a
time when they were out of vs  possibly having used vv in
place of some ws etc  this was a common practice of the day
as print was still quite expensive and they didnt want to spend
more on a wider selection of characters than they had to

you will find a lot of these kinds of errors in this text as i
have mentioned in other times and places many scholars have an
extreme attachment to these errors and many have accorded them a
very high place in the canon of shakespeare  my father read an
assortment of these made available to him by cambridge university
in england for several months in a glass room constructed for the
purpose  to the best of my knowledge he read all those available
  in great detail  and determined from the various changes
that shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
variety of errors we credit him for even though he was infamous
for signing his name with several different spellings

so please take this into account when reading the comments below
made by our volunteer who prepared this file  you may see errors
that are not errors   

so  with this caveat  we have not changed the canon errors
here is the project gutenberg etext of shakespeares the tragedie
of othello the moore of venice

scanners notes what this is and isnt  this was taken from
a copy of shakespeares first folio and it is as close as i can
come in ascii to the printed text

the elongated ss have been changed to small ss and the
conjoined ae have been changed to ae  i have left the spelling
punctuation capitalization as close as possible to the
printed text  i have corrected some spelling mistakes i have put
together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
geneva bible and shakespeares first folio and have unified
spellings according to this template typos and expanded
abbreviations as i have come across them  everything within
brackets  is what i have added  so if you dont like that
you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
purer shakespeare

another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
differences between various copies of the first folio  so there may
be differences other than what i have mentioned above between
this and other first folio editions  this is due to the printers
habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
continuing the printing run  the proof run wasnt thrown away but
incorporated into the printed copies  this is just the way it is
the text i have used was a composite of more than 30 different
first folio editions best pages

if you find any scanning errors out and out typos punctuation
errors or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
free to email me those errors  i wish to make this the best
etext possible  my email address for right now are haraddaaolcom
and davidrinconnectcom  i hope that you enjoy this

against your honor that with the little godlinesse i haue
i did full hard forbeare him but i pray you sir
are you fast married be assurd of this
that the magnifico is much beloud
and hath in his effect a voice potentiall
as double as the dukes he will diuorce you
or put vpon you what restraint or greeuance
the law with all his might to enforce it on
will giue him cable

   othel let him do his spight

it is a businesse of some heate the gallies

this very night at one anothers heeles

   othe keepe vp your bright swords for the dew will

yeares then with your weapons

   bra oh thou foule theefe
where hast thou stowd my daughter
damnd as thou art thou hast enchaunted her
for ile referre me to all things of sense
if she in chaines of magick were not bound
whether a maid so tender faire and happie
so opposite to marriage that she shund
the wealthy curled deareling of our nation
would euer haue t encurre a generall mocke
run from her guardage to the sootie bosome
of such a thing as thou to feare not to delight
iudge me the world if tis not grosse in sense
that thou hast practisd on her with foule charmes
abusd her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
that weakens motion ile hauet disputed on
tis probable and palpable to thinking
i therefore apprehend and do attach thee
for an abuser of the world a practiser
of arts inhibited and out of warrant
lay hold vpon him if he do resist
subdue him at his perill

   othe hold your hands
both you of my inclining and the rest
were it my cue to fight i should haue knowne it
without a prompter whether will you that i goe
to answere this your charge
  bra to prison till fit time
of law and course of direct session
call thee to answer

   othe what if i do obey
how may the duke be therewith satisfid
whose messengers are heere about my side
vpon some present businesse of the state
to bring me to him

   officer tis true most worthy signior
the dukes in counsell and your noble selfe
i am sure is sent for

   bra how the duke in counsell
in this time of the night bring him away
mines not an idle cause the duke himselfe
or any of my brothers of the state
cannot but feele this wrong as twere their owne
for if such actions may haue passage free

scaena tertia

enter duke senators and officers

  duke theres no composition in this newes
that giues them credite

   1sen indeed they are disproportioned
my letters say a hundred and seuen gallies

   duke and mine a hundred fortie

   2sena and mine two hundred
but though they iumpe not on a iust accompt
as in these cases where the ayme reports
tis oft with difference yet do they all confirme
a turkish fleete and bearing vp to cyprus

   duke nay it is possible enough to iudgement
i do not so secure me in the error
but the maine article i do approue
in fearefull sense

   saylor within what hoa what hoa what hoa

enter saylor

  officer a messenger from the gallies

   duke now whats the businesse
  sailor the turkish preparation makes for rhodes
so was i bid report here to the state
by signior angelo

   duke how say you by this change
  1sen this cannot be
by no assay of reason tis a pageant
to keepe vs in false gaze when we consider
th importancie of cyprus to the turke
and let our selues againe but vnderstand
that as it more concernes the turke then rhodes
so may he with more facile question beare it
for that it stands not in such warrelike brace
but altogether lackes th abilities
that rhodes is dressd in if we make thought of this
we must not thinke the turke is so vnskillfull
to leaue that latest which concernes him first
neglecting an attempt of ease and gaine
to wake and wage a danger profitlesse

   duke nay in all confidence hes not for rhodes

   officer here is more newes

enter a messenger

  messen the ottamites reuerend and gracious
steering with due course toward the ile of rhodes
haue there inioynted them with an after fleete

   1sen i so i thought how many as you guesse
  mess of thirtie saile and now they do restem
their backward course bearing with frank appearance
their purposes toward cyprus signior montano
your trustie and most valiant seruitour
with his free dutie recommends you thus
and prayes you to beleeue him

   duke tis certaine then for cyprus
marcus luccicos is not he in towne
  1sen hes now in florence

   1sen here comes brabantio and the valiant moore

enter brabantio othello cassio iago rodorigo and officers

  duke valiant othello we must straight employ you
against the generall enemy ottoman
i did not see you welcome gentle signior
we lackt your counsaile and your helpe to night

   bra so did i yours good your grace pardon me
neither my place nor ought i heard of businesse
hath raisd me from my bed nor doth the generall care
take hold on me for my perticular griefe
is of so floodgate and orebearing nature
that it engluts and swallowes other sorrowes
and it is still it selfe

   duke why whats the matter
  bra my daughter oh my daughter
  sen dead
  bra i to me
she is abusd stolne from me and corrupted
by spels and medicines bought of mountebanks
for nature so prepostrously to erre
being not deficient blind or lame of sense
sans witchcraft could not

   duke who ere he be that in this foule proceeding
hath thus beguild your daughter of her selfe
and you of her the bloodie booke of law
you shall your selfe read in the bitter letter
after your owne sense yea though our proper son
stood in your action

   bra humbly i thanke your grace
here is the man this moore whom now it seemes
your speciall mandate for the state affaires
hath hither brought

   all we are verie sorry fort

   duke what in your owne part can you say to this
  bra nothing but this is so

   othe most potent graue and reuerend signiors
my very noble and approud good masters
that i haue tane away this old mans daughter
it is most true true i haue married her
the verie head and front of my offending
hath this extent no more rude am i in my speech
and little blessd with the soft phrase of peace
for since these armes of mine had seuen yeares pith
till now some nine moones wasted they haue vsd
their deerest action in the tented field
and little of this great world can i speake
more then pertaines to feats of broiles and battaile
and therefore little shall i grace my cause
in speaking for my selfe yet by your gratious patience
i will a round vnvarnishd tale deliuer
of my whole course of loue
what drugges what charmes
what coniuration and what mighty magicke
for such proceeding i am chargd withall
i won his daughter

   bra a maiden neuer bold
of spirit so still and quiet that her motion
blushd at her selfe and she in spight of nature
of yeares of country credite euery thing
to fall in loue with what she feard to looke on
it is a iudgement maind and most imperfect
that will confesse perfection so could erre
against all rules of nature and must be driuen
to find out practises of cunning hell
why this should be i therefore vouch againe
that with some mixtures powrefull ore the blood
or with some dram coniurd to this effect
he wrought vpon her
to vouch this is no proofe
without more wider and more ouer test
then these thin habits and poore likelyhoods
of moderne seeming do prefer against him

   sen but othello speake
did you by indirect and forced courses
subdue and poyson this yong maides affections
or came it by request and such faire question
as soule to soule affordeth
  othel i do beseech you
send for the lady to the sagitary
and let her speake of me before her father
if you do finde me foule in her report
the trust the office i do hold of you
not onely take away but let your sentence
euen fall vpon my life

   duke fetch desdemona hither

   othe aunciant conduct them
you best know the place
and tell she come as truely as to heauen
i do confesse the vices of my blood
so iustly to your graue eares ile present
how i did thriue in this faire ladies loue
and she in mine

   duke say it othello

   othe her father loud me oft inuited me
still questiond me the storie of my life
from yeare to yeare the battaile sieges fortune
that i haue past
i ran it through euen from my boyish daies
toth very moment that he bad me tell it
wherein i spoke of most disastrous chances
of mouing accidents by flood and field
of hairebreadth scapes ith imminent deadly breach
of being taken by the insolent foe
and sold to slauery of my redemption thence
and portance in my trauellours historie
wherein of antars vast and desarts idle
rough quarries rocks hills whose head touch heauen
it was my hint to speake such was my processe
and of the canibals that each others eate
the antropophague and men whose heads
grew beneath their shoulders these things to heare
would desdemona seriously incline
but still the house affaires would draw her hence
which euer as she could with haste dispatch
sheld come againe and with a greedie eare
deuoure vp my discourse which i obseruing
tooke once a pliant houre and found good meanes
to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
that i would all my pilgrimage dilate
whereof by parcels she had something heard
but not instinctiuely i did consent
and often did beguile her of her teares
when i did speake of some distressefull stroke
that my youth sufferd my storie being done
she gaue me for my paines a world of kisses
she swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange
twas pittifull twas wondrous pittifull
she wishd she had not heard it yet she wishd
that heauen had made her such a man she thankd me
and bad me if i had a friend that loud her
i should but teach him how to tell my story
and that would wooe her vpon this hint i spake
she loud me for the dangers i had past
and i loud her that she did pitty them
this onely is the witchcraft i haue vsd
here comes the ladie let her witnesse it

enter desdemona iago attendants

  duke i thinke this tale would win my daughter too
good brabantio take vp this mangled matter at the best
men do their broken weapons rather vse
then their bare hands

   bra i pray you heare her speake
if she confesse that she was halfe the wooer
destruction on my head if my bad blame
light on the man come hither gentle mistris
do you perceiue in all this noble companie
where most you owe obedience
  des my noble father
i do perceiue heere a diuided dutie
to you i am bound for life and education
my life and education both do learne me
how to respect you you are the lord of duty
i am hitherto your daughter but heeres my husband
and so much dutie as my mother shewd
to you preferring you before her father
so much i challenge that i may professe
due to the moore my lord

   bra god be with you i haue done
please it your grace on to the state affaires
i had rather to adopt a child then get it
come hither moore
i here do giue thee that with all my heart
which but thou hast already with all my heart
i would keepe from thee for your sake iewell
i am glad at soule i haue no other child
for thy escape would teach me tirranie
to hang clogges on them i haue done my lord

   duke let me speake like your selfe
and lay a sentence
which as a grise or step may helpe these louers
when remedies are past the griefes are ended
by seeing the worst which late on hopes depended
to mourne a mischeefe that is past and gon
is the next way to draw new mischiefe on
what cannot be preserud when fortune takes
patience her iniury a mockry makes
the robd that smiles steales something from the thiefe
he robs himselfe that spends a bootelesse griefe

   bra so let the turke of cyprus vs beguile
we loose it not so long as we can smile
he beares the sentence well that nothing beares
but the free comfort which from thence he heares
but he beares both the sentence and the sorrow
that to pay griefe must of poore patience borrow
these sentences to sugar or to gall
being strong on both sides are equiuocall
but words are words i neuer yet did heare
that the bruized heart was piercd through the eares
i humbly beseech you proceed to th affaires of state

   duke the turke with a most mighty preparation
makes for cyprus othello the fortitude of the place is
best knowne to you and though we haue there a substitute
of most allowed sufficiencie yet opinion a more
soueraigne mistris of effects throwes a more safer
voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber
the glosse of your new fortunes with this more stubborne
and boystrous expedition

   othe the tirant custome most graue senators
hath made the flinty and steele coach of warre
my thricedriuen bed of downe i do agnize
a naturall and prompt alacratie
i finde in hardnesse and do vndertake
this present warres against the ottamites
most humbly therefore bending to your state
i craue fit disposition for my wife
due reference of place and exhibition
with such accomodation and besort
as leuels with her breeding

   duke why at her fathers
  bra i will not haue it so

   othe nor i

   des nor would i there recide
to put my father in impatient thoughts
by being in his eye most gracious duke
to my vnfolding lend your prosperous eare
and let me finde a charter in your voice
t assist my simplenesse

   duke what would you desdemona
  des that i loue the moore to liue with him
my downeright violence and storme of fortunes
may trumpet to the world my hearts subdud
euen to the very quality of my lord
i saw othellos visage in his mind
and to his honours and his valiant parts
did i my soule and fortunes consecrate
so that deere lords if i be left behind
a moth of peace and he go to the warre
the rites for why i loue him are bereft me
and i a heauie interim shall support
by his deere absence let me go with him

   othe let her haue your voice
vouch with me heauen i therefore beg it not
to please the pallate of my appetite
nor to comply with heat the yong affects
in my defunct and proper satisfaction
but to be free and bounteous to her minde
and heauen defend your good soules that you thinke
i will your serious and great businesse scant
when she is with me no when light wingd toyes
of featherd cupid seele with wanton dulnesse
my speculatiue and officd instrument
that my disports corrupt and taint my businesse
let housewiues make a skillet of my helme
and all indigne and base aduersities
make head against my estimation

   duke be it as you shall priuately determine
either for her stay or going th affaire cries hast
and speed must answer it

   sen you must away to night

   othe with all my heart

   duke at nine ith morning here weel meete againe
othello leaue some officer behind
and he shall our commission bring to you
and such things else of qualitie and respect
as doth import you

   othe so please your grace my ancient
a man he is of honesty and trust
to his conueyance i assigne my wife
with what else needfull your good grace shall think
to be sent after me

   duke let it be so
good night to euery one and noble signior
if vertue no delighted beautie lacke
your soninlaw is farre more faire then blacke

   sen adieu braue moore vse desdemona well

   bra looke to her moore if thou hast eies to see
she has deceiud her father and may thee
enter

  othe my life vpon her faith honest iago
my desdemona must i leaue to thee
i prythee let thy wife attend on her
and bring them after in the best aduantage
come desdemona i haue but an houre
of loue of wordly matter and direction
to spend with thee we must obey the time
enter

  rod iago

   iago what saist thou noble heart
  rod what will i do thinkst thou
  iago why go to bed and sleepe

   rod i will incontinently drowne my selfe

   iago if thou dost i shall neuer loue thee after why
thou silly gentleman
  rod it is sillynesse to liue when to liue is torment
and then haue we a prescription to dye when death is
our physition

   iago oh villanous i haue lookd vpon the world
for foure times seuen yeares and since i could distinguish
betwixt a benefit and an iniurie i neuer found man that
knew how to loue himselfe ere i would say i would
drowne my selfe for the loue of a gynney hen i would
change my humanity with a baboone

   rod what should i do i confesse it is my shame
to be so fond but it is not in my vertue to amend it

   iago vertue a figge tis in our selues that we are
thus or thus our bodies are our gardens to the which
our wills are gardiners so that if we will plant nettels
or sowe lettice set hisope and weede vp time
supplie it with one gender of hearbes or distract it with
many either to haue it sterrill with idlenesse or manured
with industry why the power and corrigeable authoritie
of this lies in our wills if the braine of our liues
had not one scale of reason to poize another of sensualitie
the blood and basenesse of our natures would
conduct vs to most prepostrous conclusions but we
haue reason to coole our raging motions our carnall
stings or vnbitted lusts whereof i take this that you
call loue to be a sect or seyen

   rod it cannot be

   iago it is meerly a lust of the blood and a permission
of the will come be a man drowne thy selfe drown
cats and blind puppies i haue profest me thy friend
and i confesse me knit to thy deseruing with cables of
perdurable toughnesse i could neuer better steed thee
then now put money in thy purse follow thou the
warres defeate thy fauour with an vsurpd beard i say
put money in thy purse it cannot be long that desdemona
should continue her loue to the moore put money in
thy purse nor he his to her it was a violent commencement
in her and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration
put but money in thy purse these moores
are changeable in their wils fill thy purse with money
the food that to him now is as lushious as locusts
shalbe to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida she
must change for youth when she is sated with his body
she will find the errors of her choice therefore put money
in thy purse if thou wilt needs damne thy selfe do
it a more delicate way then drowning make all the money
thou canst if sanctimonie and a fraile vow betwixt
an erring barbarian and supersubtle venetian be
not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou
shalt enioy her therefore make money a pox of drowning
thy selfe it is cleane out of the way seeke thou rather
to be hangd in compassing thy ioy then to be
drownd and go without her

   rodo wilt thou be fast to my hopes if i depend on
the issue
  iago thou art sure of me go make money i haue
told thee often and i retell thee againe and againe i
hate the moore my cause is hearted thine hath no lesse
reason let vs be coniunctiue in our reuenge against
him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thy selfe a
pleasure me a sport there are many euents in the
wombe of time which wilbe deliuered trauerse go
prouide thy money we will haue more of this to morrow
adieu

   rod where shall we meete ith morning
  iago at my lodging

   rod ile be with thee betimes

   iago go too farewell do you heare rodorigo
  rod ile sell all my land

  iago thus do i euer make my foole my purse
for i mine owne gaind knowledge should prophane
if i would time expend with such snipe
but for my sport and profit i hate the moore
and it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets
she has done my office i know not ift be true

good ancient you are welcome welcome mistris
let it not gaule your patience good iago
that i extend my manners tis my breeding
that giues me this bold shew of curtesie

   iago sir would she giue you so much of her lippes
as of her tongue she oft bestowes on me
you would haue enough

   des alas she has no speech

   iago infaith too much
i finde it still when i haue leaue to sleepe
marry before your ladyship i grant
she puts her tongue a little in her heart
and chides with thinking

   aemil you haue little cause to say so

   iago come on come on you are pictures out of
doore bells in your parlours wildecats in your kitchens
saints in your iniuries diuels being offended
players in your huswiferie and huswiues in your
beds

  iago i madam

   des i am not merry but i do beguile
the thing i am by seeming otherwise
come how wouldst thou praise me
  iago i am about it but indeed my inuention comes
from my pate as birdlyme dos from freeze it pluckes
out braines and all but my muse labours and thus she
is deliuerd
if she be faire and wise fairenesse and wit
the ones for vse the other vseth it

for euen her folly helpt her to an heire

   desde these are old fond paradoxes to make fooles
laugh ith alehouse what miserable praise hast thou
for her thats foule and foolish

   iago theres none so foule and foolish thereunto
but dos foule pranks which faire and wiseones do

   desde oh heauy ignorance thou praisest the worst
best but what praise couldst thou bestow on a deseruing
woman indeed one that in the authorithy of her
merit did iustly put on the vouch of very malice it
selfe

   iago she that was euer faire and neuer proud
had tongue at will and yet was neuer loud
neuer lackt gold and yet went neuer gay
fled from her wish and yet said now i may
she that being angred her reuenge being nie
bad her wrong stay and her displeasure flie
she that in wisedome neuer was so fraile
to change the codshead for the salmons taile
she that could thinke and neur disclose her mind
see suitors following and not looke behind
she was a wight if euer such wightes were
  des to do what
  iago to suckle fooles and chronicle small beere

   desde oh most lame and impotent conclusion do
not learne of him aemillia though he be thy husband
how say you cassio is he not a most prophane and liberall
counsailor
  cassio he speakes home madam you may rellish
him more in the souldier then in the scholler

   iago he takes her by the palme i well said whisper
with as little a web as this will i ensnare as great
a fly as cassio i smile vpon her do i will giue thee
in thine owne courtship you say true tis so indeed
if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantrie
it had beene better you had not kissd your three fingers
so oft which now againe you are most apt to play
the sir in very good well kissd and excellent curtsie
tis so indeed yet againe your fingers to your
lippes would they were clusterpipes for your
sake

   cassio tis truely so

   des lets meete him and recieue him

   cassio loe where he comes

  oth o my faire warriour

   des my deere othello

   othe it giues me wonder great as my content
to see you heere before me
oh my soules ioy
if after euery tempest come such calmes
may the windes blow till they haue wakend death
and let the labouring barke climbe hills of seas
olympus high and duck againe as low
as hells from heauen if it were now to dye
twere now to be most happy for i feare
my soule hath her content so absolute
that not another comfort like to this
succeedes in vnknowne fate

   des the heauens forbid
but that our loues
and comforts should encrease
euen as our dayes do grow

   othe amen to that sweet powers
i cannot speake enough of this content
it stoppes me heere it is too much of ioy
and this and this the greatest discords be
that ere our hearts shall make

   iago oh you are well tund now but ile set downe
the peggs that make this musicke as honest as i am

   othe come let vs to the castle
newes friends our warres are done
the turkes are drownd
how dos my old acquaintance of this isle
hony you shall be well desird in cyprus
i haue found great loue amongst them oh my sweet
i prattle out of fashion and i doate
in mine owne comforts i prythee good iago
go to the bay and disimbarke my coffers
bring thou the master to the cittadell
he is a good one and his worthynesse
dos challenge much respect come desdemona
once more well met at cyprus

exit othello and desdemona

  iago do thou meet me presently at the harbour
come thither if thou best valiant as they say base men
being in loue haue then a nobilitie in their natures
more then is natiue to them listme the lieutenant to
night watches on the court of guard first i must tell
thee this desdemona is directly in loue with him

   rod with him why tis not possible

   iago lay thy finger thus and let thy soule be instructed
marke me with what violence she first loud
the moore but for bragging and telling her fantasticall
lies to loue him still for prating let not thy discreet
heart thinke it her eye must be fed and what delight
shall she haue to looke on the diuell when the blood
is made dull with the act of sport there should be a
game to enflame it and to giue satiety a fresh appetite
louelinesse in fauour simpathy in yeares manners
and beauties all which the moore is defectiue in now
for want of these requird conueniences her delicate
tendernesse wil finde it selfe abusd begin to heaue the
gorge disrellish and abhorre the moore very nature wil
instruct her in it and compell her to some second choice
now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and vnforcd
position who stands so eminent in the degree of
this fortune as cassio dos a knaue very voluble no
further conscionable then in putting on the meere forme
of ciuill and humaine seeming for the better compasse
of his salt and most hidden loose affection why none
why none a slipper and subtle knaue a finder of occasion
that hes an eye can stampe and counterfeit aduantages
though true aduantage neuer present it selfe
a diuelish knaue besides the knaue is handsome young
and hath all those requisites in him that folly and greene
mindes looke after a pestilent compleat knaue and the
woman hath found him already

   rodo i cannot beleeue that in her shes full of most
blessd condition

   iago blessd figgesend the wine she drinkes is
made of grapes if shee had beene blessd shee would
neuer haue loud the moore blessd pudding didst thou
not see her paddle with the palme of his hand didst not
marke that
  rod yes that i did but that was but curtesie

   iago  leacherie by this hand an index and obscure
prologue to the history of lust and foule thoughts
they met so neere with their lippes that their breathes
embracd together villanous thoughts rodorigo when
these mutabilities so marshall the way hard at hand
comes the master and maine exercise th incorporate
conclusion pish but sir be you ruld by me i haue
brought you from venice watch you to night for
the command ile layt vpon you cassio knowes you
not ile not be farre from you do you finde some occasion
to anger cassio either by speaking too loud or
tainting his discipline or from what other course
you please which the time shall more fauorably minister

   rod well

   iago sir hes rash and very sodaine in choller and
happely may strike at you prouoke him that he may for
euen out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny
whose qualification shall come into no true taste againe
but by the displanting of cassio so shall you
haue a shorter iourney to your desires by the meanes i
shall then haue to preferre them and the impediment
most profitably remoued without the which there were
no expectation of our prosperitie

   rodo i will do this if you can bring it to any opportunity

   iago i warrant thee meete me by and by at the
cittadell i must fetch his necessaries a shore farewell

   rodo adieu
enter

  iago that cassio loues her i do well beleeut
that she loues him tis apt and of great credite
the moore howbeit that i endure him not
is of a constant louing noble nature
and i dare thinke hele proue to desdemona
a most deere husband now i do loue her too
not out of absolute lust though peraduenture
i stand accomptant for as great a sin
but partely led to dyet my reuenge
for that i do suspect the lustie moore
hath leapd into my seate the thought whereof
doth like a poysonous minerall gnaw my inwardes
and nothing can or shall content my soule
till i am eeuend with him wife for wife
or fayling so yet that i put the moore
at least into a ielouzie so strong
that iudgement cannot cure which thing to do
if this poore trash of venice whom i trace
for his quicke hunting stand the putting on
ile haue our michael cassio on the hip
abuse him to the moore in the right garbe
for i feare cassio with my nightcape too
make the moore thanke me loue me and reward me
for making him egregiously an asse
and practising vpon his peace and quiet
euen to madnesse tis heere but yet confusd
knaueries plaine face is neuer seene till vsd

hele watch the horologe a double set
if drinke rocke not his cradle

enter rodorigo

  iago how now rodorigo

i do loue cassio well and would do much

   oth why how now hoa from whence ariseth this
are we turnd turkes and to our selues do that
which heauen hath forbid the ottamittes
for christian shame put by this barbarous brawle
he that stirs next to carue for his owne rage
holds his soule light he dies vpon his motion
silence that dreadfull bell it frights the isle
from her propriety what is the matter masters
honest iago that lookes dead with greeuing
speake who began this on thy loue i charge thee
  iago i do not know friends all but now euen now
in quarter and in termes like bride and groome
deuesting them for bed and then but now
as if some planet had vnwitted men
swords out and tilting one at others breastes
in opposition bloody i cannot speake
any begining to this peeuish oddes
and would in action glorious i had lost
those legges that brought me to a part of it

   othe how comes it michaell you are thus forgot
  cas i pray you pardon me i cannot speake

   othe worthy montano you were wont to be ciuill
the grauitie and stillnesse of your youth
the world hath noted and your name is great
in mouthes of wisest censure whats the matter
that you vnlace your reputation thus
and spend your rich opinion for the name
of a nightbrawler giue me answer to it

   mon worthy othello i am hurt to danger
your officer iago can informe you
while i spare speech which something now offends me
of all that i do know nor know i ought
by me thats said or done amisse this night
vnlesse selfecharitie be sometimes a vice
and to defend our selues it be a sinne
when violence assailes vs

   othe now by heauen
my blood begins my safer guides to rule
and passion hauing my best iudgement collied
assaies to leade the way if i once stir
or do but lift this arme the best of you
shall sinke in my rebuke giue me to know
how this foule rout began who set it on
and he that is approud in this offence
though he had twinnd with me both at a birth
shall loose me what in a towne of warre
yet wilde the peoples hearts brimfull of feare
to manage priuate and domesticke quarrell
in night and on the court and guard of safetie
tis monstrous iago who begant
  mon if partially affind or league in office
thou dost deliuer more or lesse then truth
thou art no souldier

   iago touch me not so neere
i had rather haue this tongue cut from my mouth
then it should do offence to michaell cassio
yet i perswade my selfe to speake the truth
shall nothing wrong him this it is generall
montano and my selfe being in speech
there comes a fellow crying out for helpe
and cassio following him with determind sword
to execute vpon him sir this gentleman
steppes in to cassio and entreats his pause
my selfe the crying fellow did pursue
least by his clamour as it so fell out
the towne might fall in fright he swift of foote
outran my purpose and i returnd then rather
for that i heard the clinke and fall of swords
and cassio high in oath which till to night
i nere might say before when i came backe
for this was briefe i found them close together
at blow and thrust euen as againe they were
when you your selfe did part them
more of this matter cannot i report
but men are men the best sometimes forget
though cassio did some little wrong to him
as men in rage strike those that wish them best
yet surely cassio i beleeue receiud
from him that fled some strange indignitie

myselfe and what remaines is bestiall my reputation
iago my reputation

   iago as i am an honest man i had thought you had
receiued some bodily wound there is more sence in that
then in reputation reputation is an idle and most false
imposition oft got without merit and lost without deseruing
you haue lost no reputation at all vnlesse you
repute your selfe such a looser what man there are
more wayes to recouer the generall againe you are
but now cast in his moode a punishment more in policie
then in malice euen so as one would beate his offencelesse
dogge to affright an imperious lyon sue to
him againe and hes yours

   cas i will rather sue to be despisd then to deceiue
so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so
indiscreet an officer drunke and speake parrat and
squabble swagger sweare and discourse fustian
with ones owne shadow oh thou invisible spirit of

sword what had he done to you
  cas i know not

a quarrell but nothing wherefore oh that
men should put an enemie in their mouthes to steale away
their braines that we should with ioy pleasance
reuell and applause transforme our selues into beasts

   iago why but you are now well enough how
came you thus recouered
  cas it hath pleasd the diuell drunkennesse to giue
place to the diuell wrath one vnperfectnesse shewes me
another to make me frankly despise my selfe

   iago come you are too seuere a moraller as the
time the place  the condition of this country stands
i could hartily wish this had not befalne but since it is as
it is mend it for your owne good

   cas i will aske him for my place againe he shall tell
me i am a drunkard had i as many mouthes as hydra
such an answer would stop them all to be now a sensible
man by and by a foole and presently a beast oh
strange euery inordinate cup is vnblessd and the ingredient

fortunes against any lay worth naming this cracke of
your loue shall grow stronger then it was before

proball to thinking and indeed the course
to win the moore againe

th inclyning desdemona to subdue
in any honest suite shes framd as fruitefull
as the free elements and then for her
to win the moore were to renownce his baptisme
all seales and simbols of redeemed sin
his soule is so enfetterd to her loue
that she may make vnmake do what she list
euen as her appetite shall play the god
with his weake function how am i then a villaine
to counsell cassio to this paralell course
directly to his good diuinitie of hell
when diuels will the blackest sinnes put on
they do suggest at first with heauenly shewes
as i do now for whiles this honest foole
plies desdemona to repaire his fortune
and she for him pleades strongly to the moore
ile powre this pestilence into his eare
that she repeales him for her bodies lust
and by how much she striues to do him good
she shall vndo her credite with the moore

or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
to your owne person nay when i haue a suite
wherein i meane to touch your loue indeed
it shall be full of poize and difficult waight
and fearefull to be granted

   iago my noble lord

   oth what dost thou say iago
  iago did michael cassio
when he wood my lady know of your loue
  oth he did from first to last
why dost thou aske
  iago but for a satisfaction of my thought
no further harme

   oth why of thy thought iago
  iago i did not thinke he had bin acquainted with hir

   oth o yes and went betweene vs very oft

   iago indeed
  oth indeed i indeed discernst thou ought in that
is he not honest
  iago honest my lord
  oth honest i honest

   iago my lord for ought i know

   oth what dost thou thinke
  iago thinke my lord
  oth thinke my lord alas thou ecchost me
as if there were some monster in thy thought
too hideous to be shewne thou dost mean somthing
i heard thee say euen now thou likst not that
when cassio left my wife what diddst not like
and when i told thee he was of my counsaile
of my whole course of wooing thou criedst indeede
and diddst contract and purse thy brow together
as if thou then haddst shut vp in thy braine
some horrible conceite if thou dost loue me
shew me thy thought

   iago my lord you know i loue you

   oth i thinke thou dost
and for i know thourt full of loue and honestie
and weighst thy words before thou giust them breath
therefore these stops of thine fright me the more
for such things in a false disloyall knaue
are trickes of custome but in a man thats iust
theyre close dilations working from the heart
that passion cannot rule

   iago for michael cassio
i dare be sworne i thinke that he is honest

   oth i thinke so too

   iago men should be what they seeme
or those that be not would they might seeme none

   oth certaine men should be what they seeme

   iago why then i thinke cassios an honest man

   oth nay yet theres more in this
i prythee speake to me as to thy thinkings
as thou dost ruminate and giue thy worst of thoughts
the worst of words

   iago good my lord pardon me
though i am bound to euery acte of dutie
i am not bound to that all slaues are free
vtter my thoughts why say they are vild and falce
as wheres that palace whereinto foule things
sometimes intrude not who has that breast so pure
wherein vncleanly apprehensions
keepe leetes and lawdayes and in sessions sit
with meditations lawfull
  oth thou dost conspire against thy friend iago
if thou but thinkst him wrongd and makst his eare
a stranger to thy thoughts

   iago i do beseech you
though i perchance am vicious in my guesse
as i confesse it is my natures plague
to spy into abuses and of my iealousie
shapes faults that are not that your wisedome
from one that so imperfectly conceits
would take no notice nor build your selfe a trouble
out of his scattering and vnsure obseruance
it were not for your quiet nor your good
nor for my manhood honesty and wisedome
to let you know my thoughts

   oth what dost thou meane
  iago good name in man  woman deere my lord
is the immediate iewell of their soules
who steales my purse steales trash
tis something nothing
twas mine tis his and has bin slaue to thousands
but he that filches from me my good name
robs me of that which not enriches him
and makes me poore indeed

   oth ile know thy thoughts

   iago you cannot if my heart were in your hand
nor shall not whilst tis in my custodie

   oth ha
  iago oh beware my lord of iealousie
it is the greeneeyd monster which doth mocke
the meate it feeds on that cuckold liues in blisse
who certaine of his fate loues not his wronger
but oh what damned minutes tels he ore
who dotes yet doubts suspects yet soundly loues
  oth o miserie

   iago poore and content is rich and rich enough
but riches finelesse is as poore as winter
to him that euer feares he shall be poore
good heauen the soules of all my tribe defend
from iealousie

   oth why why is this
thinkst thou ild make a life of iealousie
to follow still the changes of the moone
with fresh suspitions no to be once in doubt
is to be resolud exchange me for a goat
when i shall turne the businesse of my soule
to such exufflicate and blowd surmises
matching thy inference tis not to make me iealious
to say my wife is faire feeds well loues company
is free of speech sings playes and dances
where vertue is these are more vertuous
nor from mine owne weake merites will i draw
the smallest feare or doubt of her reuolt
for she had eyes and chose me no iago
ile see before i doubt when i doubt proue
and on the proofe there is no more but this
away at once with loue or iealousie

   ia i am glad of this for now i shall haue reason
to shew the loue and duty that i beare you
with franker spirit therefore as i am bound
receiue it from me i speake not yet of proofe
looke to your wife obserue her well with cassio
weare your eyes thus not iealious nor secure
i would not haue your free and noble nature
out of selfebounty be abusd looke toot
i know our country disposition well
in venice they do let heauen see the prankes
they dare not shew their husbands
their best conscience
is not to leauet vndone but kept vnknowne

   oth dost thou say so
  iago she did deceiue her father marrying you
and when she seemd to shake and feare your lookes
she loud them most

   oth and so she did

   iago why go too then
shee that so young could giue out such a seeming
to seele her fathers eyes vp close as oake
he thought twas witchcraft
but i am much too blame
i humbly do beseech you of your pardon
for too much louing you

   oth i am bound to thee for euer

   iago i see this hath a little dashd your spirits
  oth not a iot not a iot

   iago trust me i feare it has
i hope you will consider what is spoke
comes from your loue
but i do see yare mooud
i am to pray you not to straine my speech
to grosser issues nor to larger reach
then to suspition

   oth i will not

   iago should you do so my lord
my speech should fall into such vilde successe
which my thoughts aymd not
cassios my worthy friend
my lord i see yare moud

   oth no not much moud
i do not thinke but desdemonas honest

   iago long liue she so
and long liue you to thinke so

   oth and yet how nature erring from it selfe

   iago i theres the point
as to be bold with you
not to affect many proposed matches
of her owne clime complexion and degree
whereto we see in all things nature tends
foh one may smel in such a will most ranke
foule disproportions thoughts vnnaturall
but pardon me i do not in position
distinctly speake of her though i may feare
her will recoyling to her better iudgement
may fal to match you with her country formes
and happily repent

   oth farewell farewell
if more thou dost perceiue let me know more
set on thy wife to obserue
leaue me iago

   iago my lord i take my leaue

   othel why did i marry

sees and knowes more much more then he vnfolds

   iago my lord i would i might intreat your honor
to scan this thing no farther leaue it to time
although tis fit that cassio haue his place
for sure he filles it vp with great ability
yet if you please to him off awhile

note if your lady straine his entertainment
with any strong or vehement importunitie

and being troubled with a raging tooth
i could not sleepe there are a kinde of men
so loose of soule that in their sleepes will mutter
their affayres one of this kinde is cassio
in sleepe i heard him say sweet desdemona
let vs be wary let vs hide our loues
and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand
cry oh sweet creature then kisse me hard
as if he pluckt vp kisses by the rootes
that grew vpon my lippes laid his leg ore my thigh
and sigh and kisse and then cry cursed fate
that gaue thee to the moore

the thoughts of people she told her while she kept it
t would make her amiable and subdue my father
intirely to her loue but if she lost it
or made a guift of it my fathers eye
should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
after new fancies she dying gaue it me

make it a darling like your precious eye
to looset or giuet away were such perdition

if my offence be of such mortall kinde
that nor my seruice past nor present sorrowes
nor purposd merit in futurity

so shall i cloath me in a forcd content
and shut my selfe vp in some other course
to fortunes almes

throwing restraint vpon vs or say they strike vs
or scant our former hauing in despight

when they change vs for others is it sport
i thinke it is and doth affection breed it
i thinke it doth ist frailty that thus erres

desires for sport and frailty as men haue
then let them vse vs well else let them know

came in and satisfid him

how came you cassio by that handkerchiefe
that was my wiues

and he himselfe confest it but euen now

which wrought to his desire

   othel o foole foole foole

how he vpbraides iago that he made him
braue me vpon the watch whereon it came
that i was cast and euen but now he spake
after long seeming dead iago hurt him
iago set him on

   lod you must forsake this roome and go with vs
your power and your command is taken off
and cassio rules in cyprus for this slaue

that can torment him much and hold him long
it shall be his you shall close prisoner rest
till that the nature of your fault be knowne
to the venetian state come bring away

   oth soft you a word or two before you goe
i haue done the state some seruice and they knowt
no more of that i pray you in your letters
when you shall these vnluckie deeds relate
speake of me as i am nothing extenuate
nor set downe ought in malice
then must you speake
of one that loud not wisely but too well
of one not easily iealious but being wrought
perplexed in the extreame of one whose hand
like the base iudean threw a pearle away
richer then all his tribe of one whose subdud eyes
albeit vnvsed to the melting moode
drops teares as fast as the arabian trees
their medicinable gumme set you downe this
and say besides that in aleppo once
where a malignant and a turbondturke
beate a venetian and traducd the state
i tooke by th throat the circumcised dogge
and smoate him thus

   lod oh bloody period

   gra all that is spoke is marrd

   oth i kist thee ere i killd thee no way but this
killing my selfe to dye vpon a kisse

dyes

  cas this did i feare but thought he had no weapon
for he was great of heart

   lod oh sparton dogge
more fell then anguish hunger or the sea
looke on the tragicke loading of this bed
this is thy worke
the obiect poysons sight
let it be hid gratiano keepe the house
and seize vpon the fortunes of the moore
for they succeede on you to you lord gouernor
remaines the censure of this hellish villaine
the time the place the torture oh inforce it

    he swung about his head and cut the winds

  m wife o where is romeo saw you him today
    right glad i am he was not at this fray

  ben madam an hour before the worshippd sun
    peerd forth the golden window of the east
    a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad
    where underneath the grove of sycamore
    that westward rooteth from the citys side
    so early walking did i see your son
    towards him i made but he was ware of me
    and stole into the covert of the wood
    i measuring his affections by my own
    which then most sought where most might not be found
    being one too many by my weary self
    pursud my humour not pursuing his
    and gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me

  mon many a morning hath he there been seen
    with tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew
    adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
    but all so soon as the allcheering sun
    should in the furthest east bean to draw
    the shady curtains from auroras bed
    away from light steals home my heavy son
    and private in his chamber pens himself
    shuts up his windows locks fair daylight
    and makes himself an artificial night
    black and portentous must this humour prove
    unless good counsel may the cause remove

  ben my noble uncle do you know the cause

  mon i neither know it nor can learn of him

  ben have you importund him by any means

  mon both by myself and many other friend
    but he his own affections counsellor
    is to himself i will not say how true
    but to himself so secret and so close
    so far from sounding and discovery
    as is the bud bit with an envious worm
    ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
    or dedicate his beauty to the sun
    could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
    we would as willingly give cure as know

                       enter romeo

    ill know his grievance or be much denied

scene iv
a street

enter romeo mercutio benvolio with five or six other maskers
torchbearers


  rom what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
    or shall we on without apology

  ben the date is out of such prolixity
    well have no cupid hoodwinkd with a scarf
    bearing a tartars painted bow of lath
    scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper
    nor no withoutbook prologue faintly spoke
    after the prompter for our entrance
    but let them measure us by what they will
    well measure them a measure and be gone

  rom give me a torch i am not for this ambling
    being but heavy i will bear the light

  mer nay gentle romeo we must have you dance

  rom not i believe me you have dancing shoes
    with nimble soles i have a soul of lead
    so stakes me to the ground i cannot move

  mer you are a lover borrow cupids wings
    and soar with them above a common bound

  rom i am too sore enpierced with his shaft
    to soar with his light feathers and so bound
    i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
    under loves heavy burthen do i sink

  mer and to sink in it should you burthen love
    too great oppression for a tender thing

  rom is love a tender thing it is too rough
    too rude too boistrous and it pricks like thorn

  mer if love be rough with you be rough with love
    prick love for pricking and you beat love down
    give me a case to put my visage in
    a visor for a visor what care i
    what curious eye doth quote deformities
    here are the beetle brows shall blush for me

  ben come knock and enter and no sooner in
    but every man betake him to his legs

  rom a torch for me let wantons light of heart
    tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
    for i am proverbd with a grandsire phrase
    ill be a candleholder and look on
    the game was neer so fair and i am done

  mer tut duns the mouse the constables own word
    if thou art dun well draw thee from the mire
    of this sirreverence love wherein thou stickst
    up to the ears come we burn daylight ho

  rom nay thats not so

  mer i mean sir in delay
    we waste our lights in vain like lamps by day
    take our good meaning for our judgment sits
    five times in that ere once in our five wits

  rom and we mean well in going to this masque
    but tis no wit to go

  mer why may one ask

  rom i dreamt a dream tonight

  mer and so did i

  rom well what was yours

  mer that dreamers often lie

  rom in bed asleep while they do dream things true

  mer o then i see queen mab hath been with you
    she is the fairies midwife and she comes
    in shape no bigger than an agate stone
    on the forefinger of an alderman
    drawn with a team of little atomies
    athwart mens noses as they lie asleep
    her wagon spokes made of long spinners legs
    the cover of the wings of grasshoppers
    her traces of the smallest spiders web
    her collars of the moonshines watry beams
    her whip of crickets bone the lash of film
    her wagoner a small greycoated gnat
    not half so big as a round little worm
    prickd from the lazy finger of a maid
    her chariot is an empty hazelnut
    made by the joiner squirrel or old grub
    time out o mind the fairies coachmakers
    and in this state she gallops night by night
    through lovers brains and then they dream of love
    oer courtiers knees that dream on cursies straight
    oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees
    oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream
    which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues
    because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
    sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose
    and then dreams he of smelling out a suit
    and sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail
    tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep
    then dreams he of another benefice
    sometimes she driveth oer a soldiers neck
    and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
    of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades
    of healths five fadom deep and then anon
    drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
    and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
    and sleeps again this is that very mab
    that plats the manes of horses in the night
    and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs
    which once untangled much misfortune bodes
    this is the hag when maids lie on their backs
    that presses them and learns them first to bear
    making them women of good carriage
    this is she

  rom peace peace mercutio peace
    thou talkst of nothing

  mer true i talk of dreams
    which are the children of an idle brain
    begot of nothing but vain fantasy
    which is as thin of substance as the air
    and more inconstant than the wind who wooes
    even now the frozen bosom of the north
    and being angerd puffs away from thence

  chor now old desire doth in his deathbed lie
    and young affection gapes to be his heir
    that fair for which love groand for and would die
    with tender juliet matchd is now not fair
    now romeo is belovd and loves again
    alike bewitched by the charm of looks
    but to his foe supposd he must complain
    and she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks
    being held a foe he may not have access
    to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear
    and she as much in love her means much less
    to meet her new beloved anywhere
    but passion lends them power time means to meet

    but soft what light through yonder window breaks
    it is the east and juliet is the sun
    arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
    who is already sick and pale with grief
    that thou her maid art far more fair than she
    be not her maid since she is envious
    her vestal livery is but sick and green
    and none but fools do wear it cast it off
    it is my lady o it is my love
    o that she knew she were
    she speaks yet she says nothing what of that
    her eye discourses i will answer it
    i am too bold tis not to me she speaks
    two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
    having some business do entreat her eyes
    to twinkle in their spheres till they return
    what if her eyes were there they in her head
    the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
    as daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
    would through the airy region stream so bright
    that birds would sing and think it were not night
    see how she leans her cheek upon her hand
    o that i were a glove upon that hand
    that i might touch that cheek

  jul ay me

  rom she speaks
    o speak again bright angel for thou art
    as glorious to this night being oer my head
    as is a winged messenger of heaven
    unto the whiteupturned wondring eyes
    of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
    when he bestrides the lazypacing clouds
    and sails upon the bosom of the air

  jul o romeo romeo wherefore art thou romeo
    deny thy father and refuse thy name
    or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
    and ill no longer be a capulet

    nor arm nor face nor any other part
    belonging to a man o be some other name
    whats in a name that which we call a rose
    by any other name would smell as sweet
    so romeo would were he not romeo calld
    retain that dear perfection which he owes
    without that title romeo doff thy name
    and for that name which is no part of thee
    take all myself

  rom i take thee at thy word

    because it is an enemy to thee

    of that tongues utterance yet i know the sound
    art thou not romeo and a montague

  rom neither fair saint if either thee dislike

    the orchard walls are high and hard to climb
    and the place death considering who thou art
    if any of my kinsmen find thee here

  rom with loves light wings did i oerperch these walls
    for stony limits cannot hold love out
    and what love can do that dares love attempt
    therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me

  jul if they do see thee they will murther thee

  rom alack there lies more peril in thine eye
    than twenty of their swords look thou but sweet
    and i am proof against their enmity

    and but thou love me let them find me here
    my life were better ended by their hate
    than death prorogued wanting of thy love

  jul by whose direction foundst thou out this place

  rom by love that first did prompt me to enquire
    he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes

  jul thou knowest the mask of night is on my face
    else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
    for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
    fain would i dwell on form fain fain deny
    what i have spoke but farewell compliment
    dost thou love me i know thou wilt say ay
    and i will take thy word yet if thou swearst
    thou mayst prove false at lovers perjuries
    they say jove laughs o gentle romeo
    if thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
    or if thou thinkest i am too quickly won
    ill frown and be perverse and say thee nay
    so thou wilt woo but else not for the world
    in truth fair montague i am too fond
    and therefore thou mayst think my haviour light
    but trust me gentleman ill prove more true
    than those that have more cunning to be strange
    i should have been more strange i must confess
    but that thou overheardst ere i was ware
    my truelove passion therefore pardon me
    and not impute this yielding to light love
    which the dark night hath so discovered

  rom lady by yonder blessed moon i swear
    that tips with silver all these fruittree tops

  jul o swear not by the moon th inconstant moon
    that monthly changes in her circled orb
    lest that thy love prove likewise variable

    which is the god of my idolatry
    and ill believe thee

  jul well do not swear although i joy in thee
    i have no joy of this contract tonight

    too like the lightning which doth cease to be
    ere one can say it lightens sweet good night

    may prove a beauteous flowr when next we meet
    good night good night as sweet repose and rest

scene iii
friar laurences cell

enter friar laurence alone with a basket


  friar the greyeyd morn smiles on the frowning night
    checkring the eastern clouds with streaks of light
    and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
    from forth days path and titans fiery wheels
    non ere the sun advance his burning eye
    the day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry
    i must upfill this osier cage of ours
    with baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers
    the earth thats natures mother is her tomb
    what is her burying gave that is her womb
    and from her womb children of divers kind
    we sucking on her natural bosom find
    many for many virtues excellent
    none but for some and yet all different
    o mickle is the powerful grace that lies
    in plants herbs stones and their true qualities
    for naught so vile that on the earth doth live
    but to the earth some special good doth give
    nor aught so good but straind from that fair use
    revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
    virtue itself turns vice being misapplied
    and vice sometimes by action dignified
    within the infant rind of this small flower
    poison hath residence and medicine power
    for this being smelt with that part cheers each part
    being tasted slays all senses with the heart
    two such opposed kings encamp them still
    in man as well as herbs grace and rude will
    and where the worser is predominant
    full soon the canker death eats up that plant

                        enter romeo


  rom good morrow father

  friar benedicite
    what early tongue so sweet saluteth me
    young son it argues a distempered head
    so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
    care keeps his watch in every old mans eye
    and where care lodges sleep will never lie
    but where unbruised youth with unstuffd brain
    doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
    therefore thy earliness doth me assure
    thou art uprousd with some distemprature
    or if not so then here i hit it right
    our romeo hath not been in bed tonight

  rom that last is truethe sweeter rest was mine

  friar god pardon sin wast thou with rosaline

  rom with rosaline my ghostly father no
    i have forgot that name and that names woe

  friar thats my good son but where hast thou been then

  rom ill tell thee ere thou ask it me again
    i have been feasting with mine enemy
    where on a sudden one hath wounded me
    thats by me wounded both our remedies
    within thy help and holy physic lies
    i bear no hatred blessed man for lo
    my intercession likewise steads my foe

  friar be plain good son and homely in thy drift
    riddling confession finds but riddling shrift

  rom then plainly know my hearts dear love is set
    on the fair daughter of rich capulet
    as mine on hers so hers is set on mine
    and all combind save what thou must combine
    by holy marriage when and where and how
    we met we wood and made exchange of vow
    ill tell thee as we pass but this i pray
    that thou consent to marry us today

  friar holy saint francis what a change is here
    is rosaline that thou didst love so dear
    so soon forsaken young mens love then lies
    not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
    jesu maria what a deal of brine
    hath washd thy sallow cheeks for rosaline
    how much salt water thrown away in waste
    to season love that of it doth not taste
    the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears
    thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears
    lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit

    it is enough i may but call her mine

  friar these violent delights have violent ends
    and in their triumph die like fire and powder
    which as they kiss consume the sweetest honey
    is loathsome in his own deliciousness

    the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl
    there lies the man slain by young romeo
    that slew thy kinsman brave mercutio

  cap wife tybalt my cousin o my brothers child
    o prince o husband o the blood is spilld
    of my dear kinsman prince as thou art true
    for blood of ours shed blood of montague
    o cousin cousin

  prince benvolio who began this bloody fray

  ben tybalt here slain whom romeos hand did stay
    romeo that spoke him fair bid him bethink
    how nice the quarrel was and urgd withal
    your high displeasure all this uttered
    with gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowd
    could not take truce with the unruly spleen
    of tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts
    with piercing steel at bold mercutios breast
    who all as hot turns deadly point to point
    and with a martial scorn with one hand beats
    cold death aside and with the other sends
    it back to tybalt whose dexterity
    retorts it romeo he cries aloud
    hold friends friends part and swifter than his tongue
    his agile arm beats down their fatal points
    and twixt them rushes underneath whose arm
    an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life
    of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled
    but byandby comes back to romeo
    who had but newly entertaind revenge
    and tot they go like lightning for ere i
    could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain
    and as he fell did romeo turn and fly
    this is the truth or let benvolio die

  cap wife he is a kinsman to the montague
    affection makes him false he speaks not true
    some twenty of them fought in this black strife
    and all those twenty could but kill one life
    i beg for justice which thou prince must give
    romeo slew tybalt romeo must not live

  prince romeo slew him he slew mercutio
    who now the price of his dear blood doth owe

  mon not romeo prince he was mercutios friend
    his fault concludes but what the law should end
    the life of tybalt

  prince and for that offence
    immediately we do exile him hence
    i have an interest in your hates proceeding
    my blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding
    but ill amerce you with so strong a fine
    that you shall all repent the loss of mine
    i will be deaf to pleading and excuses
    nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
    therefore use none let romeo hence in haste
    else when he is found that hour is his last
    bear hence this body and attend our will
    mercy but murders pardoning those that kill
                                                         exeunt

    a damned saint an honourable villain
    o nature what hadst thou to do in hell
    when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
    in mortal paradise of such sweet flesh

    but o it presses to my memory
    like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds
    tybalt is dead and romeo banished
    that banished that one word banished
    hath slain ten thousand tybalts tybalts death
    was woe enough if it had ended there
    or if sour woe delights in fellowship
    and needly will be rankd with other griefs
    why followed not when she said tybalts dead
    thy father or thy mother nay or both
    which modern lamentation might have movd
    but with a rearward following tybalts death
    romeo is banished to speak that word

    all slain all dead romeo is banished
    there is no end no limit measure bound
    in that words death no words can that woe sound

  rom what less than doomsday is the princes doom

  friar a gentler judgment vanishd from his lips
    not bodys death but bodys banishment

  rom ha banishment be merciful say death
    for exile hath more terror in his look
    much more than death do not say banishment

  friar hence from verona art thou banished
    be patient for the world is broad and wide

  rom there is no world without verona walls
    but purgatory torture hell itself
    hence banished is banishd from the world
    and worlds exile is death then banishment
    is death mistermd calling death banishment
    thou cutst my head off with a golden axe
    and smilest upon the stroke that murders me

  friar o deadly sin o rude unthankfulness
    thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince
    taking thy part hath rushd aside the law
    and turnd that black word death to banishment
    this is dear mercy and thou seest it not

  rom tis torture and not mercy heaven is here
    where juliet lives and every cat and dog
    and little mouse every unworthy thing
    live here in heaven and may look on her
    but romeo may not more validity
    more honourable state more courtship lives
    in carrion flies than romeo they may seize
    on the white wonder of dear juliets hand
    and steal immortal blessing from her lips
    who even in pure and vestal modesty
    still blush as thinking their own kisses sin
    but romeo may not he is banished
    this may flies do when i from this must fly
    they are free men but i am banished
    and sayest thou yet that exile is not death
    hadst thou no poison mixd no sharpground knife
    no sudden mean of death though neer so mean
    but banished to kill me banished
    o friar the damned use that word in hell
    howling attends it how hast thou the heart
    being a divine a ghostly confessor
    a sinabsolver and my friend professd
    to mangle me with that word banished

  friar thou fond mad man hear me a little speak

  rom o thou wilt speak again of banishment

  friar ill give thee armour to keep off that word
    adversitys sweet milk philosophy
    to comfort thee though thou art banished

    displant a town reverse a princes doom
    it helps not it prevails not talk no more

  friar o then i see that madmen have no ears

  rom how should they when that wise men have no eyes

  friar let me dispute with thee of thy estate

  rom thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
    wert thou as young as i juliet thy love
    an hour but married tybalt murdered
    doting like me and like me banished
    then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair
    and fall upon the ground as i do now
    taking the measure of an unmade grave
                                                 knock within

    and now falls on her bed and then starts up
    and tybalt calls and then on romeo cries
    and then down falls again

    shot from the deadly level of a gun
    did murther her as that names cursed hand
    murderd her kinsman o tell me friar tell me
    in what vile part of this anatomy
    doth my name lodge tell me that i may sack
    the hateful mansion                     draws his dagger

  friar hold thy desperate hand
    art thou a man thy form cries out thou art
    thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote
    the unreasonable fury of a beast
    unseemly woman in a seeming man
    or illbeseeming beast in seeming both
    thou hast amazd me by my holy order
    i thought thy disposition better temperd
    hast thou slain tybalt wilt thou slay thyself
    and slay thy lady that in thy life lives
    by doing damned hate upon thyself
    why railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
    since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
    in thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
    fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit
    which like a usurer aboundst in all
    and usest none in that true use indeed
    which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
    thy noble shape is but a form of wax
    digressing from the valour of a man
    thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury
    killing that love which thou hast vowd to cherish
    thy wit that ornament to shape and love
    misshapen in the conduct of them both
    like powder in a skilless soldiers flask
    is get afire by thine own ignorance
    and thou dismembred with thine own defence
    what rouse thee man thy juliet is alive
    for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead
    there art thou happy tybalt would kill thee
    but thou slewest tybalt there art thou happy too
    the law that threatned death becomes thy friend
    and turns it to exile there art thou happy
    a pack of blessings light upon thy back
    happiness courts thee in her best array
    but like a misbhavd and sullen wench
    thou poutst upon thy fortune and thy love
    take heed take heed for such die miserable
    go get thee to thy love as was decreed
    ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
    but look thou stay not till the watch be set
    for then thou canst not pass to mantua
    where thou shalt live till we can find a time
    to blaze your marriage reconcile your friends
    beg pardon of the prince and call thee back
    with twenty hundred thousand times more joy
    than thou wentst forth in lamentation
    go before nurse commend me to thy lady
    and bid her hasten all the house to bed
    which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
    romeo is coming

  friar on thursday sir the time is very short

  par my father capulet will have it so
    and i am nothing slow to slack his haste

  friar you say you do not know the ladys mind
    uneven is the course i like it not

  par immoderately she weeps for tybalts death
    and therefore have i little talkd of love
    for venus smiles not in a house of tears
    now sir her father counts it dangerous
    that she do give her sorrow so much sway
    and in his wisdom hastes our marriage
    to stop the inundation of her tears
    which too much minded by herself alone
    may be put from her by society
    now do you know the reason of this haste

  friar aside i would i knew not why it should be slowd
    look sir here comes the lady toward my cell

                    enter juliet


  par happily met my lady and my wife

  jul that may be sir when i may be a wife

  par that may be must be love on thursday next

  jul what must be shall be

  friar thats a certain text

  par come you to make confession to this father

  jul to answer that i should confess to you

  par do not deny to him that you love me

  jul i will confess to you that i love him

  par so will ye i am sure that you love me

  jul if i do so it will be of more price
    being spoke behind your back than to your face

  par poor soul thy face is much abusd with tears

  jul the tears have got small victory by that
    for it was bad enough before their spite

  par thou wrongst it more than tears with that report

  jul that is no slander sir which is a truth
    and what i spake i spake it to my face

  par thy face is mine and thou hast slandred it

  jul it may be so for it is not mine own
    are you at leisure holy father now
    or shall i come to you at evening mass

  friar my leisure serves me pensive daughter now
    my lord we must entreat the time alone

  par god shield i should disturb devotion
    juliet on thursday early will i rouse ye
    till then adieu and keep this holy kiss             exit

  jul o shut the door and when thou hast done so
    come weep with me past hope past cure past help

  friar ah juliet i already know thy grief
    it strains me past the compass of my wits
    i hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it
    on thursday next be married to this county

  jul tell me not friar that thou hearst of this
    unless thou tell me how i may prevent it
    if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help
    do thou but call my resolution wise
    and with this knife ill help it presently
    god joind my heart and romeos thou our hands
    and ere this hand by thee to romeos seald
    shall be the label to another deed
    or my true heart with treacherous revolt
    turn to another this shall slay them both
    therefore out of thy longexperiencd time
    give me some present counsel or behold
    twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
    shall play the empire arbitrating that
    which the commission of thy years and art
    could to no issue of true honour bring
    be not so long to speak i long to die
    if what thou speakst speak not of remedy

  friar hold daughter i do spy a kind of hope
    which craves as desperate an execution
    as that is desperate which we would prevent
    if rather than to marry county paris
    thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
    then is it likely thou wilt undertake
    a thing like death to chide away this shame
    that copst with death himself to scape from it
    and if thou darst ill give thee remedy

  jul o bid me leap rather than marry paris
    from off the battlements of yonder tower
    or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
    where serpents are chain me with roaring bears
    or shut me nightly in a charnel house
    oercoverd quite with dead mens rattling bones
    with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
    or bid me go into a newmade grave
    and hide me with a dead man in his shroud
    things that to hear them told have made me tremble
    and i will do it without fear or doubt
    to live an unstaind wife to my sweet love

  friar hold then go home be merry give consent
    to marry paris wednesday is tomorrow
    tomorrow night look that thou lie alone
    let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
    take thou this vial being then in bed
    and this distilled liquor drink thou off
    when presently through all thy veins shall run
    a cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
    shall keep his native progress but surcease
    no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
    the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
    to paly ashes thy eyes windows fall
    like death when he shuts up the day of life
    each part deprivd of supple government
    shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
    and in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
    thou shalt continue twoandforty hours
    and then awake as from a pleasant sleep
    now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
    to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
    then as the manner of our country is
    in thy best robes uncovered on the bier
    thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
    where all the kindred of the capulets lie
    in the mean time against thou shalt awake
    shall romeo by my letters know our drift
    and hither shall he come and he and i
    will watch thy waking and that very night
    shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua
    and this shall free thee from this present shame
    if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
    abate thy valour in the acting it

  jul give me give me o tell not me of fear

  friar hold get you gone be strong and prosperous
    in this resolve ill send a friar with speed
    to mantua with my letters to thy lord

    come to redeem me theres a fearful point
    shall i not then be stifled in the vault
    to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
    and there die strangled ere my romeo comes
    or if i live is it not very like
    the horrible conceit of death and night
    together with the terror of the place
    as in a vault an ancient receptacle
    where for this many hundred years the bones
    of all my buried ancestors are packd
    where bloody tybalt yet but green in earth
    lies festring in his shroud where as they say
    at some hours in the night spirits resort
    alack alack is it not like that i
    so early waking what with loathsome smells
    and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth
    that living mortals hearing them run mad
    o if i wake shall i not be distraught
    environed with all these hideous fears
    and madly play with my forefathers joints
    and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud
    and in this rage with some great kinsmans bone
    as with a club dash out my desprate brains
    o look methinks i see my cousins ghost
    seeking out romeo that did spit his body
    upon a rapiers point stay tybalt stay
    romeo i come this do i drink to thee

    lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
    i dreamt my lady came and found me dead
    strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think
    and breathd such life with kisses in my lips

    in tattred weeds with overwhelming brows
    culling of simples meagre were his looks
    sharp misery had worn him to the bones
    and in his needy shop a tortoise hung
    an alligator stuffd and other skins
    of illshaped fishes and about his shelves
    a beggarly account of empty boxes
    green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds
    remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses
    were thinly scattered to make up a show
    noting this penury to myself i said
    an if a man did need a poison now
    whose sale is present death in mantua
    here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him
    o this same thought did but forerun my need
    and this same needy man must sell it me

    doth hurry from the fatal cannons womb

  apoth such mortal drugs i have but mantuas law
    is death to any he that utters them

  rom art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
    and fearest to die famine is in thy cheeks

  apoth put this in any liquid thing you will
    and drink it off and if you had the strength
    of twenty men it would dispatch you straight

  rom there is thy gold worse poison to mens souls
    doing more murther in this loathsome world
    than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell

    but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
    a precious ring a ring that i must use
    in dear employment therefore hence be gone
    but if thou jealous dost return to pry
    in what i farther shall intend to do

    and lead you even to death meantime forbear
    and let mischance be slave to patience
    bring forth the parties of suspicion

  friar i am the greatest able to do least
    yet most suspected as the time and place
    doth make against me of this direful murther
    and here i stand both to impeach and purge
    myself condemned and myself excusd

  prince then say it once what thou dost know in this

  friar i will be brief for my short date of breath
    is not so long as is a tedious tale
    romeo there dead was husband to that juliet
    and she there dead that romeos faithful wife
    i married them and their stoln marriage day
    was tybalts doomsday whose untimely death
    banishd the newmade bridegroom from this city
    for whom and not for tybalt juliet pind
    you to remove that siege of grief from her
    betrothd and would have married her perforce
    to county paris then comes she to me
    and with wild looks bid me devise some mean
    to rid her from this second marriage
    or in my cell there would she kill herself
    then gave i her so tutored by my art
    a sleeping potion which so took effect
    as i intended for it wrought on her
    the form of death meantime i writ to romeo
    that he should hither come as this dire night
    to help to take her from her borrowed grave
    being the time the potions force should cease
    but he which bore my letter friar john
    was stayd by accident and yesternight
    returnd my letter back then all alone
    at the prefixed hour of her waking
    came i to take her from her kindreds vault
    meaning to keep her closely at my cell
    till i conveniently could send to romeo
    but when i came some minute ere the time
    of her awaking here untimely lay
    the noble paris and true romeo dead
    she wakes and i entreated her come forth
    and bear this work of heaven with patience
    but then a noise did scare me from the tomb
    and she too desperate would not go with me
    but as it seems did violence on herself
    all this i know and to the marriage
    her nurse is privy and if aught in this
    miscarried by my fault let my old life
    be sacrificd some hour before his time
    unto the rigour of severest law

  prince we still have known thee for a holy man
    wheres romeos man what can he say in this

  bal i brought my master news of juliets death
    and then in post he came from mantua
    to this same place to this same monument
    this letter he early bid me give his father
    and threatned me with death going in the vault
    if i departed not and left him there

  prince give me the letter i will look on it
    where is the countys page that raisd the watch
    sirrah what made your master in this place

  boy he came with flowers to strew his ladys grave
    and bid me stand aloof and so i did
    anon comes one with light to ope the tomb
    and byandby my master drew on him
    and then i ran away to call the watch

  prince this letter doth make good the friars words
    their course of love the tidings of her death
    and here he writes that he did buy a poison
    of a poor pothecary and therewithal
    came to this vault to die and lie with juliet
    where be these enemies capulet montage
    see what a scourge is laid upon your hate
    that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
    and i for winking at you discords too
    have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punishd

  cap o brother montague give me thy hand
    this is my daughters jointure for no more
    can i demand

  mon but i can give thee more
    for i will raise her statue in pure gold
    that whiles verona by that name is known
    there shall no figure at such rate be set
    as that of true and faithful juliet

  cap as rich shall romeos by his ladys lie
    poor sacrifices of our enmity

  prince a glooming peace this morning with it brings
    the sun for sorrow will not show his head
    go hence to have more talk of these sad things
    some shall be pardond and some punished
    for never was a story of more woe
    than this of juliet and her romeo
                                                   exeunt omnes

project gutenberg etext of hamlet by shakespeare
this file should be named 1524txt or 1524zip

this etext was prepared by dianne bean


project gutenberg etexts are usually created from multiple editions
all of which are in the public domain in the united states unless a
copyright notice is included  therefore we usually do not keep
these books in compliance with any particular paper edition


we are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates leaving time for better editing

please note  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
the official release date of all project gutenberg etexts is at
midnight central time of the last day of the stated month  a
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion comment
and editing by those who wish to do so  to be sure you have an
up to date first edition xxxxx10xxxx please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month  since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date tried to fix and failed a
look at the file size will have to do but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less


information about project gutenberg one page

we produce about two million dollars for each hour we work  the
time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc  this
projected audience is one hundred million readers  if our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce 2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtysix text
files per month or 432 more etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000
if these reach just 10 of the computerized population then the
total should reach over 200 billion etexts given away this year

the goal of project gutenberg is to give away one trillion etext
files by december 31 2001  10000 x 100000000  1 trillion
this is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
which is only 5 of the present number of computer users

at our revised rates of production we will reach only onethird
of that goal by the end of 2001 or about 3333 etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly
from michael harts salary at carnegiemellon university and an
assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few
more years so we are looking for something to replace it as we
dont want project gutenberg to be so dependent on one person

we need your donations more than ever


all donations should be made to project gutenbergcmu and are
tax deductible to the extent allowable by law  cmu  carnegie

i have seen nothing

mar
horatio says tis but our fantasy
and will not let belief take hold of him
touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us
therefore i have entreated him along
with us to watch the minutes of this night
that if again this apparition come

tush tush twill not appear

ber
sit down awhile
and let us once again assail your ears
that are so fortified against our story
what we two nights have seen

hor

and let us hear bernardo speak of this

ber
last night of all
when yond same star thats westward from the pole
had made his course to illume that part of heaven
where now it burns marcellus and myself

exit ghost

mar

ber
how now horatio you tremble and look pale
is not this something more than fantasy
what think you ont

hor
before my god i might not this believe
without the sensible and true avouch
of mine own eyes

mar
is it not like the king

hor
as thou art to thyself
such was the very armour he had on
when he the ambitious norway combated
so frownd he once when in an angry parle
he smote the sledded polacks on the ice
tis strange

mar
thus twice before and jump at this dead hour
with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch

hor
in what particular thought to work i know not
but in the gross and scope of my opinion
this bodes some strange eruption to our state

mar
good now sit down and tell me he that knows
why this same strict and most observant watch
so nightly toils the subject of the land
and why such daily cast of brazen cannon
and foreign mart for implements of war
why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task
does not divide the sunday from the week
what might be toward that this sweaty haste
doth make the night jointlabourer with the day
who ist that can inform me

hor
that can i
at least the whisper goes so our last king
whose image even but now appeard to us
was as you know by fortinbras of norway
thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride
dard to the combat in which our valiant hamlet
for so this side of our known world esteemd him
did slay this fortinbras who by a seald compact
well ratified by law and heraldry
did forfeit with his life all those his lands
which he stood seizd of to the conqueror
against the which a moiety competent
was gaged by our king which had returnd
to the inheritance of fortinbras
had he been vanquisher as by the same covnant
and carriage of the article designd
his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras
of unimproved mettle hot and full
hath in the skirts of norway here and there
sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes
for food and diet to some enterprise
that hath a stomach int which is no other
as it doth well appear unto our state
but to recover of us by strong hand
and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands
so by his father lost and this i take it
is the main motive of our preparations
the source of this our watch and the chief head
of this posthaste and romage in the land

ber
i think it be no other but een so
well may it sort that this portentous figure
comes armed through our watch so like the king
that was and is the question of these wars

hor
a mote it is to trouble the minds eye
in the most high and palmy state of rome
a little ere the mightiest julius fell
the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
did squeak and gibber in the roman streets
as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
disasters in the sun and the moist star
upon whose influence neptunes empire stands
was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse
and even the like precurse of fierce events
as harbingers preceding still the fates
and prologue to the omen coming on
have heaven and earth together demonstrated
unto our climature and countrymen
but soft behold lo where it comes again

reenter ghost

ill cross it though it blast mestay illusion
if thou hast any sound or use of voice
speak to me
if there be any good thing to be done
that may to thee do ease and race to me
speak to me
if thou art privy to thy countrys fate
which happily foreknowing may avoid
o speak
or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
extorted treasure in the womb of earth
for which they say you spirits oft walk in death
the cock crows
speak of itstay and speakstop it marcellus

mar
shall i strike at it with my partisan

hor
do if it will not stand

ber
tis here

hor
tis here

mar
tis gone

exit ghost

we do it wrong being so majestical
to offer it the show of violence
for it is as the air invulnerable
and our vain blows malicious mockery

ber
it was about to speak when the cock crew

hor
and then it started like a guilty thing
upon a fearful summons i have heard
the cock that is the trumpet to the morn
doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat
awake the god of day and at his warning
whether in sea or fire in earth or air
the extravagant and erring spirit hies
to his confine and of the truth herein
this present object made probation

mar
it faded on the crowing of the cock
some say that ever gainst that season comes
wherein our saviours birth is celebrated
the bird of dawning singeth all night long
and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad
the nights are wholesome then no planets strike
no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm
so hallowd and so gracious is the time

hor
so have i heard and do in part believe it
but look the morn in russet mantle clad
walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill
break we our watch up and by my advice
let us impart what we have seen tonight
unto young hamlet for upon my life
this spirit dumb to us will speak to him
do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
as needful in our loves fitting our duty

mar
lets dot i pray and i this morning know
where we shall find him most conveniently

scene ii elsinore a room of state in the castle

enter the king queen hamlet polonius laertes voltimand
cornelius lords and attendant

king
though yet of hamlet our dear brothers death
the memory be green and that it us befitted
to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
to be contracted in one brow of woe
yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
that we with wisest sorrow think on him
together with remembrance of ourselves
therefore our sometime sister now our queen
th imperial jointress to this warlike state
have we as twere with a defeated joy
with an auspicious and one dropping eye
with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage
in equal scale weighing delight and dole
taken to wife nor have we herein barrd
your better wisdoms which have freely gone
with this affair alongor all our thanks
now follows that you know young fortinbras
holding a weak supposal of our worth
or thinking by our late dear brothers death
our state to be disjoint and out of frame
colleagued with this dream of his advantage
he hath not faild to pester us with message
importing the surrender of those lands
lost by his father with all bonds of law
to our most valiant brother so much for him
now for ourself and for this time of meeting
thus much the business iswe have here writ
to norway uncle of young fortinbras
who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears
of this his nephews purposeto suppress
his further gait herein in that the levies
the lists and full proportions are all made
out of his subjectand we here dispatch
you good cornelius and you voltimand
for bearers of this greeting to old norway
giving to you no further personal power
to business with the king more than the scope
of these dilated articles allow
farewell and let your haste commend your duty

cor and volt
in that and all things will we show our duty

king
we doubt it nothing heartily farewell

exeunt voltimand and cornelius

and now laertes whats the news with you
you told us of some suit what ist laertes
you cannot speak of reason to the dane
and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes
that shall not be my offer not thy asking
the head is not more native to the heart
the hand more instrumental to the mouth
than is the throne of denmark to thy father
what wouldst thou have laertes

laer
dread my lord
your leave and favour to return to france
from whence though willingly i came to denmark
to show my duty in your coronation
yet now i must confess that duty done
my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france
and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon

king
have you your fathers leave what says polonius

pol
he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave
by laboursome petition and at last
upon his will i seald my hard consent
i do beseech you give him leave to go

king
take thy fair hour laertes time be thine
and thy best graces spend it at thy will
but now my cousin hamlet and my son

ham
aside a little more than kin and less than kind

king
how is it that the clouds still hang on you

ham
not so my lord i am too much i the sun

queen
good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off
and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark
do not for ever with thy vailed lids
seek for thy noble father in the dust
thou knowst tis commonall that lives must die
passing through nature to eternity

ham
ay madam it is common

queen
if it be
why seems it so particular with thee

ham
seems madam nay it is i know not seems
tis not alone my inky cloak good mother
nor customary suits of solemn black
nor windy suspiration of forcd breath
no nor the fruitful river in the eye
nor the dejected havior of the visage
together with all forms moods shows of grief
that can denote me truly these indeed seem
for they are actions that a man might play
but i have that within which passeth show
these but the trappings and the suits of woe

king
tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet
to give these mourning duties to your father
but you must know your father lost a father
that father lost lost his and the survivor bound
in filial obligation for some term
to do obsequious sorrow but to persevere
in obstinate condolement is a course
of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief
it shows a will most incorrect to heaven
a heart unfortified a mind impatient
an understanding simple and unschoold
for what we know must be and is as common
as any the most vulgar thing to sense
why should we in our peevish opposition
take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven
a fault against the dead a fault to nature
to reason most absurd whose common theme
is death of fathers and who still hath cried
from the first corse till he that died today
this must be so we pray you throw to earth
this unprevailing woe and think of us
as of a father for let the world take note
you are the most immediate to our throne
and with no less nobility of love
than that which dearest father bears his son
do i impart toward you for your intent
in going back to school in wittenberg
it is most retrograde to our desire
and we beseech you bend you to remain
here in the cheer and comfort of our eye
our chiefest courtier cousin and our son

queen
let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet
i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg

ham
i shall in all my best obey you madam

king
why tis a loving and a fair reply
be as ourself in denmarkmadam come
this gentle and unforcd accord of hamlet
sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof
no jocund health that denmark drinks today
but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell
and the kings rouse the heaven shall bruit again
respeaking earthly thunder come away

exeunt all but hamlet

ham
o that this too too solid flesh would melt
thaw and resolve itself into a dew
or that the everlasting had not fixd
his canon gainst selfslaughter o god o god
how weary stale flat and unprofitable
seem to me all the uses of this world
fie ont o fie tis an unweeded garden
that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature
possess it merely that it should come to this
but two months deadnay not so much not two
so excellent a king that was to this
hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother
that he might not beteem the winds of heaven
visit her face too roughly heaven and earth
must i remember why she would hang on him
as if increase of appetite had grown
by what it fed on and yet within a month
let me not think ontfrailty thy name is woman
a little month or ere those shoes were old
with which she followed my poor fathers body
like niobe all tearswhy she even she
o god a beast that wants discourse of reason
would have mournd longermarried with mine uncle
my fathers brother but no more like my father
than i to hercules within a month
ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
had left the flushing in her galled eyes
she married o most wicked speed to post
with such dexterity to incestuous sheets
it is not nor it cannot come to good
but break my heartfor i must hold my tongue

enter horatio marcellus and bernardo

hor
hail to your lordship

ham
i am glad to see you well

mar
my good lord

ham
i am very glad to see yougood even sir
but what in faith make you from wittenberg

hor
a truant disposition good my lord

ham
i would not hear your enemy say so
nor shall you do my ear that violence
to make it truster of your own report
against yourself i know you are no truant
but what is your affair in elsinore
well teach you to drink deep ere you depart

hor
my lord i came to see your fathers funeral

ham
i prithee do not mock me fellowstudent
i think it was to see my mothers wedding

hor
indeed my lord it followd hard upon

ham

did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables
would i had met my dearest foe in heaven
or ever i had seen that day horatio
my fathermethinks i see my father

hor
where my lord

ham
in my minds eye horatio

hor
i saw him once he was a goodly king

ham
he was a man take him for all in all
i shall not look upon his like again

hor
my lord i think i saw him yesternight

ham
saw who

hor
my lord the king your father

ham
the king my father

hor
season your admiration for awhile
with an attent ear till i may deliver
upon the witness of these gentlemen
this marvel to you

ham
for gods love let me hear

hor
two nights together had these gentlemen
marcellus and bernardo on their watch
in the dead vast and middle of the night
been thus encounterd a figure like your father
armed at point exactly capape
appears before them and with solemn march
goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkd
by their oppressd and fearsurprised eyes
within his truncheons length whilst they distilld
almost to jelly with the act of fear
stand dumb and speak not to him this to me
in dreadful secrecy impart they did
and i with them the third night kept the watch
where as they had deliverd both in time
form of the thing each word made true and good
the apparition comes i knew your father
these hands are not more like

ham
but where was this

mar
my lord upon the platform where we watchd

ham
did you not speak to it

hor
my lord i did
but answer made it none yet once methought
it lifted up it head and did address
itself to motion like as it would speak
but even then the morning cock crew loud
and at the sound it shrunk in haste away
and vanishd from our sight

ham
tis very strange

hor
as i do live my honourd lord tis true
and we did think it writ down in our duty
to let you know of it

ham
indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me
hold you the watch tonight

mar and ber
we do my lord

ham
armd say you

both
armd my lord

ham
from top to toe

both
my lord from head to foot

ham
then saw you not his face

hor
o yes my lord he wore his beaver up

ham
what lookd he frowningly

hor
a countenance more in sorrow than in anger

ham
pale or red

hor
nay very pale

ham
and fixd his eyes upon you

hor
most constantly

ham
i would i had been there

hor
it would have much amazd you

ham
very like very like stayd it long

hor
while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred

mar and ber
longer longer

hor
not when i sawt

ham
his beard was grizzledno

hor
it was as i have seen it in his life
a sable silverd

ham
i will watch tonight
perchance twill walk again

hor
i warrnt it will

ham
if it assume my noble fathers person
ill speak to it though hell itself should gape
and bid me hold my peace i pray you all
if you have hitherto conceald this sight
let it be tenable in your silence still
and whatsoever else shall hap tonight
give it an understanding but no tongue
i will requite your loves so fare ye well
upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve
ill visit you

all
our duty to your honour

ham
your loves as mine to you farewell

exeunt horatio marcellus and bernardo

my fathers spirit in arms all is not well
i doubt some foul play would the night were come
till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise
though all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyes

scene iii a room in poloniuss house

enter laertes and ophelia

laer
my necessaries are embarkd farewell
and sister as the winds give benefit
and convoy is assistant do not sleep
but let me hear from you

oph
do you doubt that

laer
for hamlet and the trifling of his favour
hold it a fashion and a toy in blood
a violet in the youth of primy nature
forward not permanent sweet not lasting
the perfume and suppliance of a minute
no more

oph
no more but so

laer
think it no more
for nature crescent does not grow alone
in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes
the inward service of the mind and soul
grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now
and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
the virtue of his will but you must fear
his greatness weighd his will is not his own
for he himself is subject to his birth
he may not as unvalud persons do
carve for himself for on his choice depends
the safety and health of this whole state
and therefore must his choice be circumscribd
unto the voice and yielding of that body
whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you
it fits your wisdom so far to believe it
as he in his particular act and place
may give his saying deed which is no further
than the main voice of denmark goes withal
then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
if with too credent ear you list his songs
or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open
to his unmasterd importunity
fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister
and keep you in the rear of your affection
out of the shot and danger of desire
the chariest maid is prodigal enough
if she unmask her beauty to the moon
virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes
the canker galls the infants of the spring
too oft before their buttons be disclosd
and in the morn and liquid dew of youth
contagious blastments are most imminent
be wary then best safety lies in fear
youth to itself rebels though none else near

oph
i shall th effect of this good lesson keep
as watchman to my heart but good my brother
do not as some ungracious pastors do
show me the steep and thorny way to heaven
whilst like a puffd and reckless libertine
himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
and recks not his own read

laer
o fear me not
i stay too longbut here my father comes

enter polonius

a double blessing is a double grace
occasion smiles upon a second leave

pol
yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame
the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail
and you are stayd for theremy blessing with thee

laying his hand on laertess head

and these few precepts in thy memory
look thou character give thy thoughts no tongue
nor any unproportiond thought his act
be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
those friends thou hast and their adoption tried
grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel
but do not dull thy palm with entertainment
of each newhatchd unfledgd comrade beware
of entrance to a quarrel but being in
beart that the opposed may beware of thee
give every man thine ear but few thy voice
take each mans censure but reserve thy judgment
costly thy habit as thy purse can buy
but not expressd in fancy rich not gaudy
for the apparel oft proclaims the man
and they in france of the best rank and station
are most select and generous chief in that
neither a borrower nor a lender be
for loan oft loses both itself and friend
and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
this above allto thine own self be true
and it must follow as the night the day
thou canst not then be false to any man
farewell my blessing season this in thee

most humbly do i take my leave my lord

pol
what ist ophelia he hath said to you

oph
so please you something touching the lord hamlet

pol
marry well bethought
tis told me he hath very oft of late
given private time to you and you yourself
have of your audience been most free and bounteous
if it be soas so tis put on me
and that in way of cautioni must tell you
you do not understand yourself so clearly
as it behooves my daughter and your honour
what is between you give me up the truth

oph
he hath my lord of late made many tenders
of his affection to me

pol
affection pooh you speak like a green girl
unsifted in such perilous circumstance
do you believe his tenders as you call them

oph
i do not know my lord what i should think

pol
marry ill teach you think yourself a baby
that you have taen these tenders for true pay
which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly
ornot to crack the wind of the poor phrase
wronging it thusyoull tender me a fool

oph
my lord he hath importund me with love
in honourable fashion

pol
ay fashion you may call it go to go to

oph
and hath given countenance to his speech my lord
with almost all the holy vows of heaven

pol
ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know
when the blood burns how prodigal the soul
lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter
giving more light than heatextinct in both
even in their promise as it is amaking
you must not take for fire from this time
be something scanter of your maiden presence
set your entreatments at a higher rate
than a command to parley for lord hamlet
believe so much in him that he is young
and with a larger tether may he walk
than may be given you in few ophelia
do not believe his vows for they are brokers
not of that dye which their investments show
but mere implorators of unholy suits
breathing like sanctified and pious bawds
the better to beguile this is for all
i would not in plain terms from this time forth
have you so slander any moment leisure
as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet
look tot i charge you come your ways

oph
i shall obey my lord

scene iv the platform

enter hamlet horatio and marcellus

ham
the air bites shrewdly it is very cold

hor
it is a nipping and an eager air

ham
what hour now

hor
i think it lacks of twelve

mar
no it is struck

hor
indeed i heard it not then draws near the season
wherein the spirit held his wont to walk

a flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within

what does this mean my lord

ham
the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse
keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels
and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down
the kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
the triumph of his pledge

hor
is it a custom

ham
ay marry ist
but to my mindthough i am native here
and to the manner bornit is a custom
more honourd in the breach than the observance
this heavyheaded revel east and west
makes us traducd and taxd of other nations
they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase
soil our addition and indeed it takes
from our achievements though performd at height
the pith and marrow of our attribute
so oft it chances in particular men
that for some vicious mole of nature in them
as in their birthwherein they are not guilty
since nature cannot choose his origin
by the oergrowth of some complexion
oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason
or by some habit that too much oerleavens
the form of plausive mannersthat these men
carrying i say the stamp of one defect
being natures livery or fortunes star
their virtues elsebe they as pure as grace
as infinite as man may undergo
shall in the general censure take corruption
from that particular fault the dram of eale
doth all the noble substance often doubt
to his own scandal

hor
look my lord it comes

enter ghost

ham
angels and ministers of grace defend us

that i will speak to thee ill call thee hamlet
king father royal dane o answer me
let me not burst in ignorance but tell
why thy canonizd bones hearsed in death
have burst their cerements why the sepulchre
wherein we saw thee quietly inurnd
hath opd his ponderous and marble jaws
to cast thee up again what may this mean
that thou dead corse again in complete steel
revisitst thus the glimpses of the moon
making night hideous and we fools of nature
so horridly to shake our disposition
with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls
say why is this wherefore what should we do

ghost beckons hamlet

hor
it beckons you to go away with it
as if it some impartment did desire
to you alone

it waves you to a more removed ground
but do not go with it

hor

ham
why what should be the fear
i do not set my life at a pins fee
and for my soul what can it do to that
being a thing immortal as itself
it waves me forth againill follow it

hor
what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord
or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
that beetles oer his base into the sea
and there assume some other horrible form
which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
and draw you into madness think of it
the very place puts toys of desperation
without more motive into every brain
that looks so many fadoms to the sea
and hears it roar beneath

ham
it waves me still
go on ill follow thee

mar
you shall not go my lord

ham
hold off your hands

hor

and makes each petty artery in this body

doomd for a certain term to walk the night
and for the day confind to wastein fires
till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
are burnt and purgd away but that i am forbid
to tell the secrets of my prisonhouse
i could a tale unfold whose lightest word
would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood
make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres
thy knotted and combined locks to part
and each particular hair to stand on end
like quills upon the fretful porcupine
but this eternal blazon must not be
to ears of flesh and bloodlist list o list
if thou didst ever thy dear father love

ham
o god

ghost
revenge his foul and most unnatural murder

ham
murder

ghost
murder most foul as in the best it is
but this most foul strange and unnatural

ham
haste me to knowt that i with wings as swift
as meditation or the thoughts of love
may sweep to my revenge

ghost
i find thee apt
and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
that rots itself in ease on lethe wharf
wouldst thou not stir in this now hamlet hear
tis given out that sleeping in my orchard
a serpent stung me so the whole ear of denmark
is by a forged process of my death
rankly abusd but know thou noble youth
the serpent that did sting thy fathers life
now wears his crown

ham
o my prophetic soul
mine uncle

ghost
ay that incestuous that adulterate beast
with witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts
o wicked wit and gifts that have the power
so to seducewon to his shameful lust
the will of my most seemingvirtuous queen
o hamlet what a fallingoff was there
from me whose love was of that dignity
that it went hand in hand even with the vow
i made to her in marriage and to decline
upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
to those of mine
but virtue as it never will be movd
though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven
so lust though to a radiant angel linkd
will sate itself in a celestial bed
and prey on garbage
but soft methinks i scent the morning air
brief let me besleeping within my orchard
my custom always of the afternoon
upon my secure hour thy uncle stole
with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial
and in the porches of my ears did pour
the leperous distilment whose effect
holds such an enmity with blood of man
that swift as quicksilver it courses through
the natural gates and alleys of the body
and with a sudden vigour it doth posset
and curd like eager droppings into milk
the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine
and a most instant tetter barkd about
most lazarlike with vile and loathsome crust
all my smooth body
thus was i sleeping by a brothers hand
of life of crown of queen at once dispatchd
cut off even in the blossoms of my sin
unhousled disappointed unaneld
no reckoning made but sent to my account
with all my imperfections on my head
o horrible o horrible most horrible
if thou hast nature in thee bear it not
let not the royal bed of denmark be
a couch for luxury and damned incest
but howsoever thou pursust this act
taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive
against thy mother aught leave her to heaven
and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
to prick and sting her fare thee well at once
the glowworm shows the matin to be near
and gins to pale his uneffectual fire
adieu adieu hamlet remember me

and thy commandment all alone shall live

of his behaviour

my lord i did intend it

pol
marry well said very well said look you sir
enquire me first what danskers are in paris
and how and who what means and where they keep
what company at what expense and finding
by this encompassment and drift of question
that they do know my son come you more nearer
than your particular demands will touch it
take you as twere some distant knowledge of him
as thus i know his father and his friends
and in part himdo you mark this reynaldo

rey
ay very well my lord

ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling
drabbingyou may go so far

rey
my lord that would dishonour him

pol
faith no as you may season it in the charge
you must not put another scandal on him
that he is open to incontinency
thats not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly
that they may seem the taints of liberty
the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind
a savageness in unreclaimed blood
of general assault

rey
but my good lord

pol
wherefore should you do this

rey
ay my lord
i would know that

pol
marry sir heres my drift
and i believe it is a fetch of warrant

having ever seen in the prenominate crimes

oph
alas my lord i have been so affrighted

pol
with what i the name of god

oph
my lord as i was sewing in my chamber
lord hamletwith his doublet all unbracd
no hat upon his head his stockings fould
ungartred and downgyved to his ankle
pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other
and with a look so piteous in purport
as if he had been loosed out of hell
to speak of horrorshe comes before me

pol
mad for thy love

oph
my lord i do not know
but truly i do fear it

pol
what said he

oph
he took me by the wrist and held me hard
then goes he to the length of all his arm
and with his other hand thus oer his brow
he falls to such perusal of my face
as he would draw it long stayd he so
at lasta little shaking of mine arm
and thrice his head thus waving up and down
he raisd a sigh so piteous and profound
as it did seem to shatter all his bulk
and end his being that done he lets me go
and with his head over his shoulder turnd
he seemd to find his way without his eyes
for out o doors he went without their help
and to the last bended their light on me

pol
come go with me i will go seek the king
this is the very ecstasy of love
whose violent property fordoes itself
and leads the will to desperate undertakings
as oft as any passion under heaven
that does afflict our natures i am sorry
what have you given him any hard words of late

oph
no my good lord but as you did command
i did repel his letters and denied
his access to me

pol
that hath made him mad
i am sorry that with better heed and judgment
i had not quoted him i feard he did but trifle
and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy
it seems it as proper to our age
to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
as it is common for the younger sort
to lack discretion come go we to the king
this must be known which being kept close might move
more grief to hide than hate to utter love

king
welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern
moreover that we much did long to see you
the need we have to use you did provoke
our hasty sending something have you heard
of hamlets transformation so i call it
since nor the exterior nor the inward man
resembles that it was what it should be
more than his fathers death that thus hath put him
so much from the understanding of himself
i cannot dream of i entreat you both
that being of so young days brought up with him
and since so neighbourd to his youth and humour
that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
some little time so by your companies
to draw him on to pleasures and to gather
so much as from occasion you may glean
whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
that opend lies within our remedy

queen
good gentlemen he hath much talkd of you
and sure i am two men there are not living
to whom he more adheres if it will please you
to show us so much gentry and goodwill
as to expend your time with us awhile
for the supply and profit of our hope
your visitation shall receive such thanks
as fits a kings remembrance

ros
both your majesties
might by the sovereign power you have of us
put your dread pleasures more into command
than to entreaty

guil
we both obey
and here give up ourselves in the full bent
to lay our service freely at your feet
to be commanded

welcome my good friends
say voltimand what from our brother norway

volt
most fair return of greetings and desires
upon our first he sent out to suppress
his nephews levies which to him appeard
to be a preparation gainst the polack
but better lookd into he truly found
it was against your highness whereat grievd
that so his sickness age and impotence
was falsely borne in handsends out arrests
on fortinbras which he in brief obeys
receives rebuke from norway and in fine
makes vow before his uncle never more
to give th assay of arms against your majesty
whereon old norway overcome with joy
gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
and his commission to employ those soldiers
so levied as before against the polack
with an entreaty herein further shown
gives a paper
that it might please you to give quiet pass
through your dominions for this enterprise
on such regards of safety and allowance
as therein are set down

king
it likes us well
and at our more considerd time well read
answer and think upon this business
meantime we thank you for your welltook labour
go to your rest at night well feast together
most welcome home

this business is well ended
my liege and madamto expostulate
what majesty should be what duty is
why day is day night is night and time is time

therefore since brevity is the soul of wit
and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes
i will be briefyour noble son is mad
mad call i it for to define true madness
what ist but to be nothing else but mad
but let that go

more matter with less art

pol
madam i swear i use no art at all
that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity
and pity tis tis true a foolish figure
but farewell it for i will use no art
mad let us grant him then and now remains
that we find out the cause of this effect
or rather say the cause of this defect
for this effect defective comes by cause
thus it remains and the remainder thus

in her excellent white bosom these c

queen
came this from hamlet to her

pol
good madam stay awhile i will be faithful
reads
  doubt thou the stars are fire
     doubt that the sun doth move
   doubt truth to be a liar
     but never doubt i love
o dear ophelia i am ill at these numbers i have not art to
reckon my groans but that i love thee best o most best believe

  thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him
     hamlet
this in obedience hath my daughter showd me
and more above hath his solicitings
as they fell out by time by means and place
all given to mine ear

king
but how hath she
receivd his love

pol
what do you think of me

king
as of a man faithful and honourable

pol
i would fain prove so but what might you think
when i had seen this hot love on the wing
as i perceivd it i must tell you that
before my daughter told me what might you
or my dear majesty your queen here think
if i had playd the desk or tablebook
or given my heart a winking mute and dumb
or lookd upon this love with idle sight
what might you think no i went round to work
and my young mistress thus i did bespeak
lord hamlet is a prince out of thy sphere
this must not be and then i precepts gave her
that she should lock herself from his resort
admit no messengers receive no tokens
which done she took the fruits of my advice
and he repulseda short tale to make
fell into a sadness then into a fast
thence to a watch thence into a weakness
thence to a lightness and by this declension
into the madness wherein now he raves
and all we wail for

king
do you think tis this

queen
it may be very likely

pol
hath there been such a timeid fain know that
that i have positively said tis so
when it provd otherwise

king
not that i know

pol
take this from this if this be otherwise
points to his head and shoulder
if circumstances lead me i will find
where truth is hid though it were hid indeed
within the centre

king
how may we try it further

pol
you know sometimes he walks for hours together
here in the lobby

queen
so he does indeed

pol
at such a time ill loose my daughter to him
be you and i behind an arras then
mark the encounter if he love her not
and he not from his reason falln thereon
let me be no assistant for a state
but keep a farm and carters

king
we will try it

queen
but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading

pol

ham
slanders sir for the satirical slave says here that old men
have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes
purging thick amber and plumtree gum and that they have a
plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which
sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it
not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir
should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward

pol
aside though this be madness yet there is a method int
will you walk out of the air my lord

ham
into my grave

pol
indeed that is out o the air aside how pregnant sometimes
his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which
reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i
will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
him and my daughtermy honourable lord i will most humbly take
my leave of you

ham
you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more
willingly part withalexcept my life except my life except my
life

my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah
rosencrantz good lads how do ye both

as the indifferent children of the earth

guil
happy in that we are not overhappy
on fortunes cap we are not the very button

ham

ros
neither my lord

ham
then you live about her waist or in the middle of her
favours

guil

ham
in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a
strumpet whats the news

ros
none my lord but that the worlds grown honest

ham
then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me
question more in particular what have you my good friends
deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison
hither

guil
prison my lord

ham
denmarks a prison

ros
then is the world one

ham
a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and
dungeons denmark being one o the worst

ros
we think not so my lord

ham
why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good
or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison

ros
why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your
mind

ham
o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams

guil
which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of
the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream

ham
a dream itself is but a shadow

ros
truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
it is but a shadows shadow

ham
then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretchd
heroes the beggars shadows shall we to the court for by my
fay i cannot reason

ros and guild
well wait upon you

ham
no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my
servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most
dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what
make you at elsinore

ros
to visit you my lord no other occasion

ham
beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you
and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were
you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free
visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak

guil
what should we say my lord

ham
why anythingbut to the purpose you were sent for and
there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties
have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen
have sent for you

ros
to what end my lord

ham
that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights
of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the
obligation of our everpreserved love and by what more dear a
better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with
me whether you were sent for or no

ros
to guildenstern what say you

ham
aside nay then i have an eye of youif you love me hold
not off

guil
my lord we were sent for

ham
i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your
discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no
feather i have of latebut wherefore i know notlost all my
mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so
heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth
seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the
air look you this brave oerhanging firmament this majestical
roof fretted with golden firewhy it appears no other thing
to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a
piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in
faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in
action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the
beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what
is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman
neither though by your smiling you seem to say so

ros
my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts

ham
why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me

ros
to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten
entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them
on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service

ham
he that plays the king shall be welcomehis majesty shall
have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall
end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickle o the sere and the lady shall say her mind
freely or the blank verse shall halt fort what players are
they

ros
even those you were wont to take such delight inthe
tragedians of the city

ham
how chances it they travel their residence both in
reputation and profit was better both ways

ros
i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
innovation

ham
do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the
city are they so followed

ros
no indeed are they not

ham
how comes it do they grow rusty

ros
nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is
sir an aery of children little eyases that cry out on the top
of question and are most tyrannically clapped fort these are
now the fashion and so berattle the common stagesso they call
themthat many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
dare scarce come thither

ham
what are they children who maintains em how are they
escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow
themselves to common playersas it is most like if their means
are no bettertheir writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
against their own succession

ros
faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation
holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for
awhile no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
went to cuffs in the question

ham
ist possible

guil
o there has been much throwing about of brains

ham
do the boys carry it away

ros
ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too

ham
it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and
those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give
twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
little sblood there is something in this more than natural if
philosophy could find it out

flourish of trumpets within

guil
there are the players

ham
gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come the
appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply
with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i
tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like
entertainment than yours you are welcome but my unclefather

anything we see well have a speech straight come give us a
taste of your quality come a passionate speech

i play
what speech my lord

ham
i heard thee speak me a speech oncebut it was never acted
or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased
not the million twas caviare to the general but it wasas i
received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in
the top of minean excellent play well digested in the scenes
set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said
there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury
nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of
affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as
sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it
i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it
especially where he speaks of priams slaughter if it live in
your memory begin at this linelet me see let me see

the rugged pyrrhus like th hyrcanian beast

it is not so it begins with pyrrhus

  the rugged pyrrhushe whose sable arms
   black as his purpose did the night resemble
   when he lay couched in the ominous horse
   hath now this dread and black complexion smeard
   with heraldry more dismal head to foot
   now is he total gules horridly trickd
   with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons
   bakd and impasted with the parching streets
   that lend a tyrannous and a damned light
   to their vile murders roasted in wrath and fire
   and thus oersized with coagulate gore
   with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus
   old grandsire priam seeks

so proceed you

pol
fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good
discretion

i play
   anon he finds him
   striking too short at greeks his antique sword
   rebellious to his arm lies where it falls
   repugnant to command unequal matchd
   pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide
   but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
   the unnerved father falls then senseless ilium
   seeming to feel this blow with flaming top
   stoops to his base and with a hideous crash
   takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword
   which was declining on the milky head
   of reverend priam seemd i the air to stick
   so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood
   and like a neutral to his will and matter
   did nothing
   but as we often see against some storm
   a silence in the heavens the rack stand still
   the bold winds speechless and the orb below
   as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder
   doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause
   a roused vengeance sets him new awork
   and never did the cyclops hammers fall
   on marss armour forgd for proof eterne
   with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword
   now falls on priam
   out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods
   in general synod take away her power
   break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel
   and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven
   as low as to the fiends

pol
this is too long

ham
it shall to the barbers with your beardprythee say on
hes for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleepssay on come

   but who o who had seen the mobled queen

ham
the mobled queen

pol
thats good mobled queen is good

i play
   run barefoot up and down threatening the flames
   with bisson rheum a clout upon that head
   where late the diadem stood and for a robe
   about her lank and all oerteemed loins
   a blanket in the alarm of fear caught up
   who this had seen with tongue in venom steepd
   gainst fortunes state would treason have pronouncd
   but if the gods themselves did see her then
   when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport
   in mincing with his sword her husbands limbs
   the instant burst of clamour that she made
   unless things mortal move them not at all
   would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
   and passion in the gods

pol
look whether he has not turnd his colour and has tears ins
eyespray you no more

ham
tis well ill have thee speak out the rest of this soon
good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you
hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief
chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a
bad epitaph than their ill report while you live

desert and who should scape whipping use them after your own
honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in
your bounty take them in

ham
ay so god b wi ye
now i am alone
o what a rogue and peasant slave am i
is it not monstrous that this player here
but in a fiction in a dream of passion
could force his soul so to his own conceit
that from her working all his visage wand
tears in his eyes distraction ins aspect
a broken voice and his whole function suiting
with forms to his conceit and all for nothing
for hecuba
whats hecuba to him or he to hecuba
that he should weep for her what would he do
had he the motive and the cue for passion
that i have he would drown the stage with tears
and cleave the general ear with horrid speech
make mad the guilty and appal the free
confound the ignorant and amaze indeed
the very faculties of eyes and ears
yet i
a dull and muddymettled rascal peak
like johnadreams unpregnant of my cause
and can say nothing no not for a king
upon whose property and most dear life
a damnd defeat was made am i a coward
who calls me villain breaks my pate across
plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i the throat
as deep as to the lungs who does me this ha
swounds i should take it for it cannot be
but i am pigeonliverd and lack gall
to make oppression bitter or ere this
i should have fatted all the region kites
with this slaves offal bloody bawdy villain
remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain
o vengeance
why what an ass am i this is most brave
that i the son of a dear father murderd
prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell
must like a whore unpack my heart with words
and fall acursing like a very drab
a scullion
fie upont fohabout my brain i have heard
that guilty creatures sitting at a play
have by the very cunning of the scene
been struck so to the soul that presently
they have proclaimd their malefactions
for murder though it have no tongue will speak
with most miraculous organ ill have these players
play something like the murder of my father
before mine uncle ill observe his looks
ill tent him to the quick if he but blench
i know my course the spirit that i have seen
may be the devil and the devil hath power
to assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps
out of my weakness and my melancholy
as he is very potent with such spirits
abuses me to damn me ill have grounds
more relative than thisthe plays the thing
wherein ill catch the conscience of the king

scene i a room in the castle

enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz and
guildenstern

king
and can you by no drift of circumstance
get from him why he puts on this confusion
grating so harshly all his days of quiet
with turbulent and dangerous lunacy

ros
he does confess he feels himself distracted
but from what cause he will by no means speak

guil
nor do we find him forward to be sounded
but with a crafty madness keeps aloof
when we would bring him on to some confession
of his true state

queen
did he receive you well

ros
most like a gentleman

guil
but with much forcing of his disposition

ros
niggard of question but of our demands
most free in his reply

queen
did you assay him
to any pastime

ros
madam it so fell out that certain players
we oerraught on the way of these we told him
and there did seem in him a kind of joy
to hear of it they are about the court
and as i think they have already order
this night to play before him

pol
tis most true
and he beseechd me to entreat your majesties
to hear and see the matter

king
with all my heart and it doth much content me
to hear him so inclind
good gentlemen give him a further edge
and drive his purpose on to these delights

ros
we shall my lord

exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern

king
sweet gertrude leave us too
for we have closely sent for hamlet hither
that he as twere by accident may here
affront ophelia
her father and myselflawful espials
will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen
we may of their encounter frankly judge
and gather by him as he is behavd
ift be the affliction of his love or no
that thus he suffers for

queen
i shall obey you
and for your part ophelia i do wish
that your good beauties be the happy cause
of hamlets wildness so shall i hope your virtues
will bring him to his wonted way again
to both your honours

oph
madam i wish it may

exit queen

pol
ophelia walk you heregracious so please you
we will bestow ourselvesto ophelia read on this book
that show of such an exercise may colour
your lonelinesswe are oft to blame in this
tis too much provdthat with devotions visage
and pious action we do sugar oer
the devil himself

king
aside o tis too true
how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience
the harlots cheek beautied with plastering art
is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
than is my deed to my most painted word
o heavy burden

pol
i hear him coming lets withdraw my lord

exeunt king and polonius

enter hamlet

ham
to be or not to bethat is the question
whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
or to take arms against a sea of troubles
and by opposing end themto dieto sleep
no more and by a sleep to say we end
the heartache and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir totis a consummation
devoutly to be wishd to dieto sleep
to sleep perchance to dreamay theres the rub
for in that sleep of death what dreams may come
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil
must give us pause theres the respect
that makes calamity of so long life
for who would bear the whips and scorns of time
the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely
the pangs of despisd love the laws delay
the insolence of office and the spurns
that patient merit of the unworthy takes
when he himself might his quietus make
with a bare bodkin who would these fardels bear
to grunt and sweat under a weary life
but that the dread of something after death
the undiscoverd country from whose bourn
no traveller returnspuzzles the will
and makes us rather bear those ills we have
than fly to others that we know not of
thus conscience does make cowards of us all
and thus the native hue of resolution
is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought
and enterprises of great pith and moment
with this regard their currents turn awry
and lose the name of actionsoft you now
the fair ophelianymph in thy orisons
be all my sins rememberd

oph
good my lord
how does your honour for this many a day

ham
i humbly thank you well well well

oph
my lord i have remembrances of yours
that i have longed long to redeliver
i pray you now receive them

ham
no not i
i never gave you aught

oph
my honourd lord you know right well you did
and with them words of so sweet breath composd
as made the things more rich their perfume lost
take these again for to the noble mind
rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind
there my lord

ham
ha ha are you honest

oph
my lord

ham
are you fair

oph
what means your lordship

ham
that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no
discourse to your beauty

oph
could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty

ham
ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform
honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox

trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your
players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do
not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all
gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say
whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a
temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the
soul to hear a robustious periwigpated fellow tear a passion to
tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who
for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for oerdoing
termagant it outherods herod pray you avoid it

i player
i warrant your honour

ham
be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your
tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with
this special observance that you oerstep not the modesty of
nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing
whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as
twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own image
scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his
form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though
it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious
grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance
oerweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i
have seen playand heard others praise and that highlynot
to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of
christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so
strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of natures
journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated
humanity so abominably

i player
i hope we have reformd that indifferently with us sir

ham
o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns
speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them
that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren
spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered thats villanous

ay or any show that youll show him be not you ashamed to
show hell not shame to tell you what it means

oph
you are naught you are naught ill mark the play

pro
   for us and for our tragedy
   here stooping to your clemency
   we beg your hearing patiently

ham
is this a prologue or the posy of a ring

oph
tis brief my lord

ham
as womans love

enter a king and a queen

p king
full thirty times hath phoebus cart gone round
neptunes salt wash and tellus orbed ground
and thirty dozen moons with borrowd sheen
about the world have times twelve thirties been
since love our hearts and hymen did our hands
unite commutual in most sacred bands

p queen
so many journeys may the sun and moon
make us again count oer ere love be done
but woe is me you are so sick of late
so far from cheer and from your former state
that i distrust you yet though i distrust
discomfort you my lord it nothing must
for womens fear and love holds quantity
in neither aught or in extremity
now what my love is proof hath made you know
and as my love is sizd my fear is so
where love is great the littlest doubts are fear
where little fears grow great great love grows there

p king
faith i must leave thee love and shortly too
my operant powers their functions leave to do
and thou shalt live in this fair world behind
honourd belovd and haply one as kind
for husband shalt thou

p queen
o confound the rest
such love must needs be treason in my breast
in second husband let me be accurst
none wed the second but who killd the first

ham
aside wormwood wormwood

p queen
the instances that second marriage move
are base respects of thrift but none of love
a second time i kill my husband dead
when second husband kisses me in bed

p king
i do believe you think what now you speak
but what we do determine oft we break
purpose is but the slave to memory
of violent birth but poor validity
which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree
but fall unshaken when they mellow be
most necessary tis that we forget
to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt
what to ourselves in passion we propose
the passion ending doth the purpose lose
the violence of either grief or joy
their own enactures with themselves destroy
where joy most revels grief doth most lament
grief joys joy grieves on slender accident
this world is not for aye nor tis not strange
that even our loves should with our fortunes change
for tis a question left us yet to prove
whether love lead fortune or else fortune love
the great man down you mark his favourite flies
the poor advancd makes friends of enemies
and hitherto doth love on fortune tend
for who not needs shall never lack a friend
and who in want a hollow friend doth try
directly seasons him his enemy
but orderly to end where i begun
our wills and fates do so contrary run
that our devices still are overthrown
our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own
so think thou wilt no second husband wed
but die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead

p queen
nor earth to me give food nor heaven light
sport and repose lock from me day and night
to desperation turn my trust and hope
an anchors cheer in prison be my scope
each opposite that blanks the face of joy
meet what i would have well and it destroy
both here and hence pursue me lasting strife
if once a widow ever i be wife

ham
if she should break it now to ophelia

p king
tis deeply sworn sweet leave me here awhile
my spirits grow dull and fain i would beguile
the tedious day with sleep
sleeps

p queen
sleep rock thy brain
and never come mischance between us twain

i stand in pause where i shall first begin
and both neglect what if this cursed hand
were thicker than itself with brothers blood
is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
to wash it white as snow whereto serves mercy
but to confront the visage of offence
and whats in prayer but this twofold force
to be forestalled ere we come to fall
or pardond being down then ill look up
my fault is past but o what form of prayer
can serve my turn forgive me my foul murder
that cannot be since i am still possessd
of those effects for which i did the murder
my crown mine own ambition and my queen
may one be pardond and retain the offence
in the corrupted currents of this world
offences gilded hand may shove by justice
and oft tis seen the wicked prize itself
buys out the law but tis not so above
there is no shufflingthere the action lies
in his true nature and we ourselves compelld
even to the teeth and forehead of our faults
to give in evidence what then what rests
try what repentance can what can it not
yet what can it when one cannot repent

what wilt thou do thou wilt not murder me
help help ho

pol
behind what ho help help help

ham
how now a rat draws
dead for a ducat dead

makes a pass through the arras

pol
behind o i am slain

falls and dies

queen
o me what hast thou done

ham
nay i know not is it the king

draws forth polonius

queen
o what a rash and bloody deed is this

ham
a bloody deedalmost as bad good mother
as kill a king and marry with his brother

queen
as kill a king

ham
ay lady twas my word
thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell
to polonius
i took thee for thy better take thy fortune
thou findst to be too busy is some danger
leave wringing of your hands peace sit you down
and let me wring your heart for so i shall
if it be made of penetrable stuff
if damned custom have not brazd it so
that it is proof and bulwark against sense

queen
what have i done that thou darst wag thy tongue
in noise so rude against me

ham
such an act
that blurs the grace and blush of modesty
calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose
from the fair forehead of an innocent love
and sets a blister there makes marriagevows
as false as dicers oaths o such a deed
as from the body of contraction plucks
the very soul and sweet religion makes
a rhapsody of words heavens face doth glow
yea this solidity and compound mass
with tristful visage as against the doom
is thoughtsick at the act

queen
ah me what act
that roars so loud and thunders in the index

ham
look here upon this picture and on this
the counterfeit presentment of two brothers
see what a grace was seated on this brow
hyperions curls the front of jove himself
an eye like mars to threaten and command
a station like the herald mercury
new lighted on a heavenkissing hill
a combination and a form indeed
where every god did seem to set his seal
to give the world assurance of a man
this was your husbandlook you now what follows
here is your husband like a milldewd ear
blasting his wholesome brother have you eyes
could you on this fair mountain leave to feed
and batten on this moor ha have you eyes
you cannot call it love for at your age
the heyday in the blood is tame its humble
and waits upon the judgment and what judgment
would step from this to this sense sure you have
else could you not have motion but sure that sense
is apoplexd for madness would not err
nor sense to ecstacy was neer so thralld
but it reservd some quantity of choice
to serve in such a difference what devil wast
that thus hath cozend you at hoodmanblind
eyes without feeling feeling without sight
ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all
or but a sickly part of one true sense
could not so mope
o shame where is thy blush rebellious hell
if thou canst mutine in a matrons bones
to flaming youth let virtue be as wax
and melt in her own fire proclaim no shame
when the compulsive ardour gives the charge
since frost itself as actively doth burn
and reason panders will

queen
o hamlet speak no more
thou turnst mine eyes into my very soul
and there i see such black and grained spots
as will not leave their tinct

ham
nay but to live
in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed
stewd in corruption honeying and making love
over the nasty sty

queen
o speak to me no more
these words like daggers enter in mine ears
no more sweet hamlet

ham
a murderer and a villain
a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
of your precedent lord a vice of kings
a cutpurse of the empire and the rule
that from a shelf the precious diadem stole
and put it in his pocket

queen
no more

ham
a king of shreds and patches

enter ghost

save me and hover oer me with your wings
you heavenly guardswhat would your gracious figure

queen
alas hes mad

ham
do you not come your tardy son to chide
that lapsd in time and passion lets go by
the important acting of your dread command
o say

ghost
do not forget this visitation
is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose
but look amazement on thy mother sits
o step between her and her fighting soul
conceit in weakest bodies strongest works
speak to her hamlet

ham
how is it with you lady

queen
alas how ist with you
that you do bend your eye on vacancy
and with the incorporal air do hold discourse
forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep
and as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm
your bedded hairs like life in excrements
start up and stand an end o gentle son
upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
sprinkle cool patience whereon do you look

ham
on him on him look you how pale he glares
his form and cause conjoind preaching to stones
would make them capabledo not look upon me
lest with this piteous action you convert
my stern effects then what i have to do
will want true colour tears perchance for blood

queen
to whom do you speak this

ham
do you see nothing there

queen
nothing at all yet all that is i see

ham
nor did you nothing hear

queen
no nothing but ourselves

ham
why look you there look how it steals away
my father in his habit as he livd
look where he goes even now out at the portal

exit ghost

queen
this is the very coinage of your brain
this bodiless creation ecstasy
is very cunning in

ham
ecstasy
my pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
and makes as healthful music it is not madness
that i have utterd bring me to the test
and i the matter will reword which madness
would gambol from mother for love of grace
lay not that flattering unction to your soul
that not your trespass but my madness speaks
it will but skin and film the ulcerous place
whilst rank corruption mining all within
infects unseen confess yourself to heaven
repent whats past avoid what is to come
and do not spread the compost on the weeds
to make them ranker forgive me this my virtue
for in the fatness of these pursy times
virtue itself of vice must pardon beg
yea curb and woo for leave to do him good

queen
o hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain

ham
o throw away the worser part of it
and live the purer with the other half
good night but go not to mine uncles bed
assume a virtue if you have it not
that monster custom who all sense doth eat
of habits evil is angel yet in this
that to the use of actions fair and good
he likewise gives a frock or livery
that aptly is put on refrain tonight
and that shall lend a kind of easiness
to the next abstinence the next more easy
for use almost can change the stamp of nature
and either curb the devil or throw him out
with wondrous potency once more goodnight
and when you are desirous to be blesd
ill blessing beg of youfor this same lord
pointing to polonius
i do repent but heaven hath pleasd it so
to punish me with this and this with me
that i must be their scourge and minister
i will bestow him and will answer well
the death i gave him so again goodnight
i must be cruel only to be kind
thus bad begins and worse remains behind
one word more good lady

queen
what shall i do

ham
not this by no means that i bid you do
let the bloat king tempt you again to bed
pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse
and let him for a pair of reechy kisses
or paddling in your neck with his damnd fingers
make you to ravel all this matter out
that i essentially am not in madness
but mad in craft twere good you let him know
for who thats but a queen fair sober wise
would from a paddock from a bat a gib
such dear concernings hide who would do so
no in despite of sense and secrecy
unpeg the basket on the houses top
let the birds fly and like the famous ape
to try conclusions in the basket creep
and break your own neck down

queen
be thou assurd if words be made of breath
and breath of life i have no life to breathe
what thou hast said to me

ham
i must to england you know that

queen
alack
i had forgot tis so concluded on

ham
theres letters seald and my two schoolfellows
whom i will trust as i will adders fangd
they bear the mandate they must sweep my way
and marshal me to knavery let it work
for tis the sport to have the enginer
hoist with his own petard and t shall go hard
but i will delve one yard below their mines
and blow them at the moon o tis most sweet
when in one line two crafts directly meet
this man shall set me packing
ill lug the guts into the neighbour room

how all occasions do inform against me
and spur my dull revenge what is a man
if his chief good and market of his time
be but to sleep and feed a beast no more
sure he that made us with such large discourse
looking before and after gave us not
that capability and godlike reason
to fust in us unusd now whether it be
bestial oblivion or some craven scruple
of thinking too precisely on the event
a thought which quarterd hath but one part wisdom
and ever three parts cowardi do not know
why yet i live to say this things to do
sith i have cause and will and strength and means
to dot examples gross as earth exhort me
witness this army of such mass and charge
led by a delicate and tender prince
whose spirit with divine ambition puffd
makes mouths at the invisible event
exposing what is mortal and unsure
to all that fortune death and danger dare
even for an eggshell rightly to be great
is not to stir without great argument
but greatly to find quarrel in a straw
when honours at the stake how stand i then
that have a father killd a mother staind
excitements of my reason and my blood
and let all sleep while to my shame i see
the imminent death of twenty thousand men
that for a fantasy and trick of fame
go to their graves like beds fight for a plot
whereon the numbers cannot try the cause
which is not tomb enough and continent
to hide the slaino from this time forth

she speaks much of her father says she hears
theres tricks i the world and hems and beats her heart
spurns enviously at straws speaks things in doubt
that carry but half sense her speech is nothing
yet the unshaped use of it doth move
the hearers to collection they aim at it
and botch the words up fit to their own thoughts
which as her winks and nods and gestures yield them
indeed would make one think there might be thought
though nothing sure yet much unhappily
twere good she were spoken with for she may strew
dangerous conjectures in illbreeding minds

king
now must your conscience my acquittance seal
and you must put me in your heart for friend
sith you have heard and with a knowing ear
that he which hath your noble father slain
pursud my life

laer
it well appearsbut tell me
why you proceeded not against these feats
so crimeful and so capital in nature
as by your safety wisdom all things else
you mainly were stirrd up

king
o for two special reasons
which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewd
but yet to me they are strong the queen his mother
lives almost by his looks and for myself
my virtue or my plague be it either which
shes so conjunctive to my life and soul
that as the star moves not but in his sphere
i could not but by her the other motive
why to a public count i might not go
is the great love the general gender bear him
who dipping all his faults in their affection
would like the spring that turneth wood to stone
convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows
too slightly timberd for so loud a wind
would have reverted to my bow again
and not where i had aimd them

laer
and so have i a noble father lost
a sister driven into desperate terms
whose worth if praises may go back again
stood challenger on mount of all the age
for her perfectionsbut my revenge will come

king
break not your sleeps for thatyou must not think
that we are made of stuff so flat and dull
that we can let our beard be shook with danger
and think it pastime you shortly shall hear more
i lovd your father and we love ourself
and that i hope will teach you to imagine

when i shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the
occasions of my sudden and more strange return       hamlet

what should this mean are all the rest come back
or is it some abuse and no such thing

laer
know you the hand

king
tis hamlets characternaked
and in a postscript here he says alone
can you advise me

laer
i am lost in it my lord but let him come
it warms the very sickness in my heart
that i shall live and tell him to his teeth
thus didest thou

king
if it be so laertes
as how should it be so how otherwise
will you be ruld by me

laer
ay my lord
so you will not oerrule me to a peace

king
to thine own peace if he be now returnd
as checking at his voyage and that he means
no more to undertake iti will work him
to exploit now ripe in my device
under the which he shall not choose but fall
and for his death no wind shall breathe
but even his mother shall uncharge the practice
and call it accident

laer
my lord i will be ruld
the rather if you could devise it so
that i might be the organ

king
it falls right
you have been talkd of since your travel much
and that in hamlets hearing for a quality
wherein they say you shine your sum of parts
did not together pluck such envy from him
as did that one and that in my regard
of the unworthiest siege

laer
what part is that my lord

king
a very riband in the cap of youth
yet needful too for youth no less becomes
the light and careless livery that it wears
than settled age his sables and his weeds
importing health and gravenesstwo months since
here was a gentleman of normandy
ive seen myself and servd against the french
and they can well on horseback but this gallant
had witchcraft int he grew unto his seat
and to such wondrous doing brought his horse
as had he been incorpsd and deminaturd
with the brave beast so far he toppd my thought
that i in forgery of shapes and tricks
come short of what he did

the very same

laer
i know him well he is the brooch indeed
and gem of all the nation

king
he made confession of you
and gave you such a masterly report
for art and exercise in your defence
and for your rapier most especially
that he cried out twould be a sight indeed
if one could match you the scrimers of their nation
he swore had neither motion guard nor eye
if you opposd them sir this report of his
did hamlet so envenom with his envy
that he could nothing do but wish and beg
your sudden coming oer to play with him
now out of this

laer
what out of this my lord

king
laertes was your father dear to you
or are you like the painting of a sorrow
a face without a heart

laer
why ask you this

king
not that i think you did not love your father
but that i know love is begun by time
and that i see in passages of proof
time qualifies the spark and fire of it
there lives within the very flame of love
a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it
and nothing is at a like goodness still
for goodness growing to a plurisy
dies in his own too much that we would do
we should do when we would for this would changes
and hath abatements and delays as many
as there are tongues are hands are accidents
and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh
that hurts by easing but to the quick o the ulcer
hamlet comes back what would you undertake
to show yourself your fathers son in deed
more than in words

laer
to cut his throat i the church

king
no place indeed should murder sanctuarize
revenge should have no bounds but good laertes
will you do this keep close within your chamber
hamlet returnd shall know you are come home
well put on those shall praise your excellence
and set a double varnish on the fame
the frenchman gave you bring you in fine together
and wager on your heads he being remiss
most generous and free from all contriving
will not peruse the foils so that with ease
or with a little shuffling you may choose
a sword unbated and in a pass of practice
requite him for your father

laer
i will dot
and for that purpose ill anoint my sword
i bought an unction of a mountebank
so mortal that but dip a knife in it
where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare
collected from all simples that have virtue
under the moon can save the thing from death
this is but scratchd withal ill touch my point
with this contagion that if i gall him slightly
it may be death

king
lets further think of this
weigh what convenience both of time and means
may fit us to our shape if this should fail
and that our drift look through our bad performance
twere better not assayd therefore this project
should have a back or second that might hold
if this did blast in proof soft let me see
well make a solemn wager on your cunnings
i hat
when in your motion you are hot and dry
as make your bouts more violent to that end
and that he calls for drink ill have prepard him
a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping
if he by chance escape your venomd stuck
our purpose may hold there

there is a willow grows aslant a brook
that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream
there with fantastic garlands did she come
of crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples
that liberal shepherds give a grosser name
but our cold maids do dead mens fingers call them
there on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
clambring to hang an envious sliver broke
when down her weedy trophies and herself
fell in the weeping brook her clothes spread wide
and mermaidlike awhile they bore her up
which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes
as one incapable of her own distress
or like a creature native and indud
unto that element but long it could not be
till that her garments heavy with their drink
pulld the poor wretch from her melodious lay
to muddy death

enough and likelihood to lead it as thus alexander died

earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he
was converted might they not stop a beerbarrel

theres a divinity that shapes our ends
roughhew them how we will

hor
that is most certain

ham
up from my cabin
my seagown scarfd about me in the dark
gropd i to find out them had my desire
fingerd their packet and in fine withdrew
to mine own room again making so bold
my fears forgetting manners to unseal
their grand commission where i found horatio
o royal knavery an exact command
larded with many several sorts of reasons
importing denmarks health and englands too
with ho such bugs and goblins in my life
that on the supervise no leisure bated
no not to stay the grinding of the axe
my head should be struck off

hor
ist possible

ham
heres the commission read it at more leisure
but wilt thou bear me how i did proceed

hor
i beseech you

ham
being thus benetted round with villanies
or i could make a prologue to my brains
they had begun the playi sat me down
devisd a new commission wrote it fair
i once did hold it as our statists do
a baseness to write fair and labourd much
how to forget that learning but sir now
it did me yeomans service wilt thou know
the effect of what i wrote

hor
ay good my lord

ham
an earnest conjuration from the king
as england was his faithful tributary
as love between them like the palm might flourish
as peace should still her wheaten garland wear
and stand a comma tween their amities
and many suchlike ass of great charge
that on the view and know of these contents
without debatement further more or less
he should the bearers put to sudden death
not shrivingtime allowd

hor
how was this seald

ham
why even in that was heaven ordinant
i had my fathers signet in my purse
which was the model of that danish seal
folded the writ up in the form of the other
subscribd it gavet the impression placd it safely
the changeling never known now the next day
was our seafight and what to this was sequent
thou knowst already

hor
so guildenstern and rosencrantz go tot

ham
why man they did make love to this employment
they are not near my conscience their defeat
does by their own insinuation grow
tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
between the pass and fell incensed points
of mighty opposites

hor
why what a king is this

ham
does it not thinkst thee stand me now upon
he that hath killd my king and whord my mother
poppd in between the election and my hopes
thrown out his angle for my proper life
and with such cozenageist not perfect conscience
to quit him with this arm and ist not to be damnd
to let this canker of our nature come
in further evil

hor
it must be shortly known to him from england
what is the issue of the business there

ham
it will be short the interim is mine
and a mans life is no more than to say one
but i am very sorry good horatio
that to laertes i forgot myself
for by the image of my cause i see
the portraiture of his ill court his favours
but sure the bravery of his grief did put me
into a towering passion

hor
peace who comes here

enter osric

osr
your lordship is right welcome back to denmark

ham
i humbly thank you sir dost know this waterfly

hor

ham
thy state is the more gracious for tis a vice to know him he
hath much land and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts and
his crib shall stand at the kings mess tis a chough but as i
say spacious in the possession of dirt

osr
sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure i should
impart a thing to you from his majesty

ham
i will receive it with all diligence of spirit put your
bonnet to his right use tis for the head

osr
i thank your lordship tis very hot

ham
no believe me tis very cold the wind is northerly

osr
it is indifferent cold my lord indeed

ham
methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion

osr
exceedingly my lord it is very sultryas twerei cannot
tell how but my lord his majesty bade me signify to you that
he has laid a great wager on your head sir this is the
matter

ham
i beseech you remember
hamlet moves him to put on his hat

osr
nay in good faith for mine ease in good faith sir here
is newly come to court laertes believe me an absolute
gentleman full of most excellent differences of very soft
society and great showing indeed to speak feelingly of him he
is the card or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the
continent of what part a gentleman would see

ham
sir his definement suffers no perdition in youthough i
know to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of
memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail
but in the verity of extolment i take him to be a soul of great
article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make
true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else
would trace him his umbrage nothing more

osr
your lordship speaks most infallibly of him

ham
the concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
rawer breath

osr
sir

hor
ist not possible to understand in another tongue you will dot
sir really

ham
what imports the nomination of this gentleman

osr
of laertes

hor
his purse is empty already alls golden words are spent

ham
of him sir

osr
i know you are not ignorant

ham
i would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not
much approve mewell sir

osr
you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is

ham
i dare not confess that lest i should compare with him in
excellence but to know a man well were to know himself

osr
i mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on
him by them in his meed hes unfellowed

ham
whats his weapon

osr
rapier and dagger

ham
thats two of his weaponsbut well

osr
the king sir hath wagerd with him six barbary horses
against the which he has imponed as i take it six french
rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and
so three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy
very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of
very liberal conceit

ham
what call you the carriages

hor
i knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done

osr
the carriages sir are the hangers

ham
the phrase would be more german to the matter if we could
carry cannon by our sides i would it might be hangers till then
but on six barbary horses against six french swords their
assigns and three liberal conceited carriages thats the french
bet against the danish why is this all imponed as you call it

osr
the king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between
your and him he shall not exceed you three hits he hath
laid on twelve for nine and it would come to immediate trial
if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer

ham
how if i answer no

osr
i mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial

ham
sir i will walk here in the hall if it please his majesty
it is the breathing time of day with me let the foils be
brought the gentleman willing and the king hold his purpose
i will win for him if i can if not i will gain nothing but my
shame and the odd hits

osr
shall i redeliver you een so

ham
to this effect sir after what flourish your nature will

osr
i commend my duty to your lordship

ham
yours yours

exit osric

he does well to commend it himself there are no tongues else
fors turn

hor
this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head

ham
he did comply with his dug before he suckd it thus has heand
many more of the same bevy that i know the drossy age dotes on
only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter
a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and
through the most fanned and winnowed opinions and do but blow
them to their trial the bubbles are out

enter a lord

lord
my lord his majesty commended him to you by young osric
who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall he sends
to know if your pleasure hold to play with laertes or that you
will take longer time

ham
i am constant to my purposes they follow the kings pleasure
if his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided
i be so able as now

lord
the king and queen and all are coming down

ham
in happy time

lord
the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
laertes before you fall to play

ham
she well instructs me

exit lord

hor
you will lose this wager my lord

ham
i do not think so since he went into france i have been in
continual practice i shall win at the odds but thou wouldst not
think how ill alls here about my heart but it is no matter

hor
nay good my lord

ham
it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
would perhaps trouble a woman

hor
if your mind dislike anything obey it i will forestall their
repair hither and say you are not fit

ham
not a whit we defy augury theres a special providence in
the fall of a sparrow if it be now tis not to come if it be
not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come
the readiness is all since no man has aught of what he leaves
what ist to leave betimes

enter king queen laertes lords osric and attendants with
foils c

king
come hamlet come and take this hand from me

the king puts laertes hand into hamlets

but pardont as you are a gentleman
this presence knows and you must needs have heard
how i am punishd with sore distraction
what i have done
that might your nature honour and exception
roughly awake i here proclaim was madness
wast hamlet wrongd laertes never hamlet
if hamlet from himself be taen away
and when hes not himself does wrong laertes
then hamlet does it not hamlet denies it
who does it then his madness ift be so
hamlet is of the faction that is wrongd
his madness is poor hamlets enemy
sir in this audience
let my disclaiming from a purposd evil
free me so far in your most generous thoughts
that i have shot my arrow oer the house
and hurt my brother

laer
i am satisfied in nature
whose motive in this case should stir me most
to my revenge but in my terms of honour
i stand aloof and will no reconcilement
till by some elder masters of known honour
i have a voice and precedent of peace
to keep my name ungord but till that time
i do receive your offerd love like love
and will not wrong it

ham

and will this brothers wager frankly play

is strict in his arresto i could tell you
but let it behoratio i am dead
thou livst report me and my cause aright
to the unsatisfied

hor
never believe it
i am more an antique roman than a dane
heres yet some liquor left

ham
as thourt a man
give me the cup let go by heaven ill havet
o good horatio what a wounded name
things standing thus unknown shall live behind me
if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
absent thee from felicity awhile
and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain
to tell my story

march afar off and shot within

what warlike noise is this

osr
young fortinbras with conquest come from poland
to the ambassadors of england gives
this warlike volley

ham
o i die horatio
the potent poison quite oercrows my spirit
i cannot live to hear the news from england
but i do prophesy the election lights
on fortinbras he has my dying voice
so tell him with the occurrents more and less
which have solicitedthe rest is silence

dies

hor
now cracks a noble heartgood night sweet prince
and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
why does the drum come hither

march within

enter fortinbras the english ambassadors and others

fort
where is this sight

hor
what is it you will see
if aught of woe or wonder cease your search

fort
this quarry cries on havoco proud death
what feast is toward in thine eternal cell
that thou so many princes at a shot
so bloodily hast struck

1 ambassador
the sight is dismal
and our affairs from england come too late
the ears are senseless that should give us hearing
to tell him his commandment is fulfilld
that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead
where should we have our thanks

hor
not from his mouth
had it the ability of life to thank you
he never gave commandment for their death
but since so jump upon this bloody question
you from the polack wars and you from england
are here arrivd give order that these bodies
high on a stage be placed to the view
and let me speak to the yet unknowing world
how these things came about so shall you hear
of carnal bloody and unnatural acts
of accidental judgments casual slaughters
of deaths put on by cunning and forcd cause
and in this upshot purposes mistook
falln on the inventors heads all this can i
truly deliver

fort
let us haste to hear it
and call the noblest to the audience
for me with sorrow i embrace my fortune
i have some rights of memory in this kingdom
which now to claim my vantage doth invite me

hor
of that i shall have also cause to speak
and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more
but let this same be presently performd
even while mens minds are wild lest more mischance
on plots and errors happen

fort
let four captains
bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage
for he was likely had he been put on
to have provd most royally and for his passage
the soldiers music and the rites of war
speak loudly for him
take up the bodiessuch a sight as this
becomes the field but here shows much amiss
go bid the soldiers shoot

a dead march

exeunt bearing off the dead bodies after the which a peal of
ordnance is shot off
